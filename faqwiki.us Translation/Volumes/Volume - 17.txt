[401] Final Decision (1)
Shirone, who handed Fleur coffee, asked if he had any clothes he had brought with him.
The flue said it was used up on the way. There were many things that could be used in an emergency, such as bandages and ropes.
After changing into the clothes Shirone gave her, she told her story while recovering her strength.
The reason why Gaold was not arrested was his paranoid distrust of humans.
No, maybe it was because his wish was so earnest that he couldn’t believe anything in the world.
This was evident from the one iron rule that Gaold laid down when he started the project 20 years ago.
When even the smallest variable occurs, cancel all plans and monitor the situation.
There was a time when Gando was absent from the Magic Association for about two hours without any reason.
In fact, it may have been just a private incident that could happen to anyone.
However, Gaold did not let go, and while disbanding the SS, he also left the association.
However, Wangseong’s response was much faster than expected, and most of the SS were arrested.
Only Gaold, Gangnan, and Fleur managed to escape by resorting to force, but the association’s pursuers also relentlessly followed their tails.
After being chased and chased like that, the place they finally arrived at was Gaold’s alma mater, Alpheas Magic School.
Shirone looked at Fleur with a pitiful expression. According to her words, it was a miracle that she got here alive.
“You really worked hard.”
Thanks to the sugar intake, Flu’s complexion improved rapidly.
When he stretched out his arm and activated the Kubrick, a magic wand decorated with a phoenix was born in front of his palm.
“I didn’t have a place to hide, but that’s not why I came all the way here. The president of the association wants to meet Alpheas. But they sent me because the tracking was too bad. Even if I’m caught, if I die, that’s it. Anyway Shirone, I need your help.”
With Gaold’s skills, it would be impossible to track them down in a normal way, but since there are many regular eaters in the association, it was better not to show up in case of an emergency.
“Where is the association president now?”
Flew got out of bed, swung his wand quickly, threw it behind his back, and headed for the door.
“I will guide you. Of course, if you want to follow me.”
Flew’s words were meant as a warning. If he wanted to get out of this situation, he meant to end it here.
“First of all, I want to meet and hear from you.”
It is inefficient to risk one’s life on false hopes.
Anyway, from the moment I entered the association, I was entangled with Gaold. In this case, she had to find a solution herself rather than hiding her face under the blanket.
‘You trained desperately, Shirone.’
Shirone’s temperament was different from three months ago. Just as life evolves in an extreme environment, Shirone also grew up in the fierce competition of the senior class.
“Yes, first listen to the president of the association and make your own judgment. But if possible… … .”
Flew passed the wand behind his back and was silent.
“I want you to help us.”
These were words that could never be uttered in front of Gaold. It was also the first gesture to treat Shirone as a wizard.
“We are leaving now.”
Shirone delayed answering and opened the door.
Wearing raincoats, the two climbed the mountain behind the building. It’s easy to cast magic, but there’s a probability close to 100% that Jonah will take it.
Gaold was hiding on the other side of the mountain range surrounding the magic school. He is not far in distance, but it is already dawn when he arrives because he has to cross the mountain.
Hiking up the mountain on a rainy day isn’t usually a forced march, but Flew flipped over the hood of his raincoat and entered the cave without even a chance to catch his breath.
“President of the Association, I brought Shirone.”
After letting Shirone in, she went out of the cave again and was wary of any pursuers.
All I could see inside the cave was darkness.
At the end of the darkness, flames soared and Gaold appeared as if only his face was floating.
Gaold, who was leaning back against the cavern and standing on one leg, smiled and raised his hand.
“Hey, Shirone.”
Just looking at Fleur’s condition gave an idea of how difficult life must have been on the run, but Gaold was still alive and well, with his signature mad smile.
“You look relaxed.”
“Hehe, it’s worth living as an unemployed person. Well, I didn’t do much work at the association either.”
Gaold pointed to the seat in front.
“Sit down. Even if I can’t serve tea, I have a bunch of stories you might like.”
Shirone asked directly.
“How did you get hurt?”
Gaold put his chin on his chin and shut his mouth like a porridge. Rather than resentment or resentment, the main feeling was resentment.
“Gando broke my corruption. Of course, most of them are fabricated corruption. It seems that even King Adolf thought that this time would be unacceptable. Actually, I’ve been patient for quite some time. The problem is that most of my bodyguards have been arrested or are still being hunted down.”
“Why didn’t I expect Gando’s betrayal? The bodyguards of the president of the association are people who have been picked and picked.”
“That’s your question. Certainly I have nothing to say about that part. That’s a good thing. But thanks to that, it’s easier to find out who’s behind the scenes. There is probably Theraze behind Gando.”
“If it’s Theraje… … .”
She is the queen of Kashan. She was also the mother of Uorin and the head of the Valkyries, whom she met in Kazura.
It was easy to guess just how powerful Theraze was by simply listing what he knew.
However, it was still unknown why Gando’s betrayal was connected to her.
“Did you ever meet Uorin in Kazura?”
“yes. I got a lot of help. She wouldn’t be where she is today if it wasn’t for her.”
“Hmm, I got some help. Yes, that’s right. Kuk-kuk.”
Shirone put on a sullen expression. She saved her life because of her, so what’s the point of laughing at her?
Gaold’s laughter stopped abruptly.
“Perhaps Theraze… … It must be mitochondrial Eve.”
“Mitochondria, Eve?”
“Except for the temple, few people know about it. Perhaps the woman you met, Uorin, is Empress Teraze.”
“Please speak so I can understand.”
Gaold described mitochondrial Eve.
Theraze can pass on her memories to her daughter through mutations in her mitochondria. It is estimated that the timing of awakening memories is different for each individual.
However, if Uorin had already awakened at the time, Shirone would have met Empress Theraze, not Uorin.
“In that way, Theraze holds all the memories from the genesis of mankind to the present. It penetrates the essence of human beings through its vast database. To her, you are just an accessory that turns the wheel of history. The proof is the strongest object that you are holding, <Demonic Sword Armand>.”
Shirone touched Armand on the waist.
I expected that it would not be a simple favor, but when I heard it, I got goosebumps. The most frightening thing was that even now, after realizing Theraze’s true identity, I couldn’t even guess what the meaning of this gift was.
“Theraze’s ability is not limited to that. You see, we live in an unusual world. Erase Guffin. In other words, it has already been reset, and it means that you are living the life after the reset. It’s speculation from here on out, but it’s highly likely that Theraze still retains her memories from before the reset. If so, it is also possible to explain why Gando was able to break through my paranoid management and join the SS.”
“From the moment Gando was born, he foresaw and planted today’s events.”
If you understand quickly, there is no need to waste time. Gaold nodded honestly.
“You got it right. No human could have predicted that far. It’s possible because it’s TheraJ.”
Certainly, in this case, even Gaold of the world could not help it.
In the end, all the limbs were cut off, and the project that had been planned for 20 years was in vain.
But with everything lost, Gaold would have had only one choice left.
“What are the odds left?”
Gaold goes to heaven. He will go even if he loses his bodyguards and even if the plans he has been designing for over half his life are in vain. Because he is the one who would risk the lives of all mankind to save the labyrinth.
Gaold leaned back leisurely and crossed his arms.
“I can’t do anything like this. But I haven’t been playing for 20 years either. It’s hard to say it’s a last resort, but everything is not lost. Anyway, you are there too.”
“I haven’t said anything about helping the association president yet.”
“Quack! Baby, don’t push yourself too hard. The reason I told you my situation is to convince you of the instructions I will give you from now on. If you do just one favor, I’ll say goodbye to you. Study hard and graduate.”
Shirone was convinced with the words he had now.
At the point of fighting the world, there was no time to worry about the welfare of students.
“But would you have made me an offer?”
One of Gaold’s eyebrows went up.
It was a transaction at the time when everything was perfect, and above all, it was a time when a year was given.
“You’re not saying you’ve found a way, are you?”
“It’s not even how… … .”
“Hmm.”
Gaold stroked his beard.
I am not a child who will make a proposal with a clumsy lie. But he didn’t have the confidence to say that he had really found something.
“Okay, listen. How are you going to destroy Heaven?”
“Before that, promise me. If you meet the conditions, please share all the information the president of the association knows. It is a matter directly related to my life. Also, the final choice to decide on going to heaven must always be with me.”
It was an unfair deal.
This is because Gaold divulges all information that could endanger his safety, while Shirone can withdraw at any time.
“Okay, let’s listen.”
Gaold readily agreed.
After all, negotiation is a process in which two selfish people meet and find a compromise. Rather, if the words were swayed by emotions, he would not have been able to trust Shirone.
It can’t be seen as particularly disadvantageous, but Shirone added the condition ‘if the conditions are met’.
Of course, if there is a way to destroy Heaven, I’m willing to take any risk.
However, even though I gave it a year, I entrusted it with the thought that it would be worth it to lose from the beginning. If it’s a foolish way, just ignore it.
And perhaps, judging from Shirone’s current skills, the result would inevitably be the latter.
‘Because there’s nothing wrong with getting even trivial information.’
Gaold thought so.
“Basically, it’s magic using ataraxia,”
“Perhaps.”
Shirone explained magic for 10 minutes.
Gaold never intervened. He just looked down at the ground and listened until the story wrapped up.
“… … If that happens, no, maybe it will destroy Heaven… … what such… … .”
When there was no response from Gaold, Shirone’s voice gradually sank. It is because when he finally said it out of his mouth, the difficulties he had only thought of in his head came higher and his confidence disappeared.
Even after Shirone finished speaking, Gaold did not answer. He was just endlessly replaying, replaying, replaying the story from a while ago.
Shirone, who was even more intimidated, added his words.
“So, as the president of the association said, once you find a possibility… … .”
“nice.”
A rustle escaped Gaold’s mouth.
“Quack! Kkkkkkk! Kkkkkkkkkkkkk!”
No matter how hard I tried to suppress it, a laugh scratched my throat. Finally, unable to hold on, he raised his head and burst into a frenzy.
“Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha ha!”
As the cave roared, Flew entered, looking startled. However, after confirming that there was nothing wrong with Ga Old, he went back to being on high alert.
Shirone stared blankly at Gaold. I didn’t know what the meaning of his smile was.
Gaold licked the corners of his mouth and glared at Shirone. The eyes reflected in the flames were blazing with fire.
“mi… … friend… … bloke.”
It was the highest compliment Gaold could give anyone.

===============================
[402] Final Decision (2)
Middle East. Paras kingdom.
On a map west of Paras, the origin of an ancient civilization, the world’s largest Akkadian Desert is colored ocher.
An endless sea of sand.
It is extremely difficult for living things to endure in this place that has been heated for eons of time.
However, human footprints were imprinted on the smooth, spread sand as if it had been applied with cream.
Where the footprints were headed, a giant pyramid called an ancient ruin stood tall like a mirage.
In the heart of the Akkadian Desert, all the oases have dried up, and even travelers can’t reach it, but few people know that this is the dungeon where the world’s most famous mage lives.
A dungeon that belongs to A2 infiltration difficulty.
The person walking leisurely inside was Kang Nan, the former chief secretary of the Tormia Magic Association.
Wherever she passed, monsters of tier 5 or higher were wriggling against the wall.
The sound of high heels hitting the stone floor echoed with high-pressure suppression of their groans.
Gangnan’s attire was a mess due to the long battle.
The button was missing, so the front was open, and the stockings were expanding in places in the form of droplets.
In his right hand he held a long horn, one of the dozens on a monster’s tail.
The tail was connected to a green body that weighed well over two tons, and at the end of the body, a basilisk, the king of the desert with a hideous depressed nose, was coming along with its tongue out.
mess.
The appearance of Gangnan dragging a monster 20 times bigger than himself was obviously foreign, but even that was a minor problem compared to the light gait that he could not feel the weight of.
Kang Nan, who arrived at the end of the labyrinth, pushed through the stone door.
It was a huge cavity, and countless creatures living in the desert were stuffed with dried skin like tree bark.
At a table 80 meters away, someone in a turban could be seen intently working with his back.
Instead of knocking, Gangnan grabbed the basilisk’s tail and threw it.
Whoops!
A majestic echo resounded in the Great Cavity.
“If you know, can’t you just let me in?”
Only then did the turbaned figure look back. She was a slender woman in a desert-colored cape.
The eyes without double eyelids were large and long, and the chin was delicately slim. He was biting on the pacifier used by newborn children, and contrasted with his deep dark eyes, it created a mysterious atmosphere overall.
“It’s been a while, Kangnan.”
The woman’s name is Zulu.
He was a certified first-class wizard of the kingdom of Paras and the only one among tier 1 monsters who could summon a lich and was the strongest summoning wizard on earth.
“yes. You seem to be doing well.”
Gangnan spoke Middle Eastern, but Zulu insisted on the continental language.
“What am I? I haven’t been out much since then.”
The custom of attaching honorific words to certain endings remained the same.
It didn’t match the grammar of the continental language, but it couldn’t be helped if it became a habit from the beginning.
“sit down. I will bring you something to drink.”
Kang Nan moved with a worried expression.
With Zulu’s skills, he could make water in one sitting, but the problem was that he didn’t do that. It seemed that when he became a first-class archmage, he developed his own rationality that was different from common sense.
As expected, Zulu poured an unknown liquid into a test beaker and set it on the table.
Kang Nan’s expression as he looked at it was uncomfortable.
If it’s not magic, water in the desert is more valuable than jewels. Even if it wasn’t drinking water, a huge amount of water would be needed to run the experiment equipment in the Great Cavity.
The fact that the stuffed monsters around them were squeezed together without a drop of moisture was not because of their eccentric tastes.
Zulu removed the black teat and savored the liquid in the beaker. Since it was precious water, Gangnando had no choice but to pretend to drink it.
“I’ll have a good drink. Surely it won’t be like the urine of desert maggots like it was 10 years ago?”
“I can’t give something like that to someone who hasn’t been in a while. It is very precious water.”
Kang Nan tilted the beaker slightly and tasted it.
As soon as my tongue started to get wet, a feeling of exhilaration rose in my throat.
“It’s fine. Then what is it?”
“It’s my pee.”
Gangnan held the beaker and spat out the water in his mouth.
It could be said that just by not spilling it on the floor, it was an enthusiastic response to the first-class archmage’s favor.
said Zulu with a smile.
“don’t worry. It is distilled water.”
“Of course it should. But I think I have a lot of this in my body.”
“Whoops. It’s still the same, Gangnan.”
Zulu recalled 10 years ago when he first met Gangnan.
Although he had a much more rustic and youthful appearance, the harshness that gripped Gaold, the world’s madman, was no less than now.
‘You’ve grown a lot.’
Gangnan at the time was a wolf shedding blood. A hostile beast that set its fangs against anyone.
But now, much of that belligerence has been captured.
If he came down to the 19th floor of the pyramid without Gaold, he would have to assume that Simma had escaped.
“The elements in the natural world cycle. There is a cycle within a cycle. The act of drinking water is not to have water, but to intervene in the great cycle of life and death and cause another cycle. Humans can assimilate with nature when they entrust themselves to a perfect cycle with nothing to throw away or leave behind.”
Gangnan listened to Zulu’s words.
Not a magician, but the truth meets at the pinnacle.
If it was the teachings of the 1st class archmage, there was nothing to discard.
“Is that the secret to being able to command the King of the Dead?”
A lich is a thought body created by combining the flames of the great wizard. Therefore, it is known that since the target is already dead, the final stage of the boss, extinction, cannot be cleared.
Rumors circulate in the academic world that Zulu himself became a lich and that the summoned beast was just a doppelganger, but Gangnan, who actually saw him summoning a lich, knew it was a lie.
When I saw it 10 years ago, I just thought it was overwhelming, but while working as the chief secretary of the Magic Association, I really became curious about the secret.
“How on earth is that even possible?”
Zulu turned her head away with sad eyes.
“This is the land of the dead.”
The explanation was there, but it seemed like he knew Gangnan.
If you are a magician who realizes the principle of circulation that you can fill it only when it is empty, there is no reason to hide the secret of your boss from the beginning. However, since that is all of life, it was just too huge to put into words.
“okay.”
The Great Cavity of the Pyramid is the cradle of Zulu.
Abandoned here as a baby, she survived alone without anyone’s help.
Did the monsters in the dungeon become their parents?
Zulu wasn’t sure.
When she came of age to come to her senses, she was still alone, and all that was left was a small black nipple that her parents must have left behind.
From then on, the Zulus made the huge dungeon their home.
Death always rested on her shoulders. When you sleep, when you have to eat, even when you breathe.
It was a different kind of survival than what people in the slums like Radum experience.
For Zulu, survival was not a longing for life, but just another death in a changed form.
Gang Nan also had a rough life, but I couldn’t even imagine what Zulu’s life would have been like.
She spent her childhood with hundreds of monsters in a dungeon where she could not find food or water.
It may have been inevitable that Zulu became the world’s strongest summoning wizard.
“I came because I have something to ask of you.”
Kang Nan, who got to the main point, bowed his head and begged until his forehead touched the table.
“Help Gaold.”
Zulu was lost in thought with her gaze somewhere. Then he slowly opened his mouth and answered in Middle Eastern.
“I get it.”
Kang Nan’s head flashed at the faster-than-expected acceptance.
In fact, getting the Zulu out of the pyramid was extremely difficult. Many of her high mages, even the royal family of Paras, begged her to become her aides, but all were refused.
Above all, Zulu is unaware of the current situation. Now that the plan we talked about 10 years ago is completely different, we have to take a risk with little chance of survival.
“sorry. There’s something I haven’t told you. Things suddenly changed… … .”
“Gaold is like a child.”
Zulu recalled the first time he met Gaold.
“He is not trying to empty anything. He holds on to the end and refuses to let go, even though he is so wrapped up in it that he is about to explode, even though he is about to die in pain.”
Kang Nan closed his mouth and listened.
“Nevertheless, the reason I was able to hold on was because I was waiting for the time to pour everything into it. Now is probably not the time. If this is also part of a larger cycle, then I think Gaold might as well stop relaxing.”
“Mr. Zulu.”
Kang Nan held back his tears and gave him strength.
Why do I shed tears when I hear the words that understand that disgusting human oblivion?
Sympathy for a madman abandoned after 20 years of hard work? If that’s not the case… … .
“and.”
Zulu said with a pretty eye smile like a child.
“Because when I’m with Gaold, something fun always happens.”
Kang Nan raised the corner of his mouth with wet eyes.
That’s it. A pure obsession that ordinary people will never understand.
It may be that he was possessed by the madness of a person who bet everything on one thing.
Zulu got up and prepared to leave.
All I had to do was to bite the pacifier and pack two water bottles in a small bag. It was a simple burden to see as a first-class archmage’s appearance.
“let’s go. It’s a quick ride to the continent if you take the Kydra.”
Kaidra, a tier 3 summon monster, was a gigantic bird that could fly 7,000 kilometers a day.
Kang Nan looked at Zulu’s back as he left the Great Hall, then lowered his head in the unique attitude of Ram Muay.
In a different way from Gaold, he was someone he respected.
‘thank you.’
Kang Nan looked back at the beaker on the table.
cycle. It can be filled only when empty. If you can’t fill it, you can’t empty it.
Taking a deep breath, she took the beaker and drank more than half full water at once.
“Eww.”
Again, this doesn’t fit.
The taste was definitely water, but it seemed that the trick of the Ilsimjo was not for anyone.
Wiping the steamy inside of his mouth with his tongue, Kang Nan followed Zulu and left the Great Hall.
* * *
As soon as the sun rose, Shirone went to the principal’s office.
The first thing Gaold asked for was to deliver the note to Alfeas.
Seeing Shirone who suddenly came, Alpheas made a surprised expression, but after reading the note, he silently nodded.
Shirone also left the principal’s office without saying a word.
There must already be kingdom intelligence agents around the school.
As long as there was no confirmation that Gaold was coming, he wouldn’t be as vigilant as the capital, but he had a sense of danger for Gaold to act alone.
‘If it’s the principal, he’ll take care of it.’
Alfeas, who has gone through all of the prenatal battles, can be relieved.
Also beside him was Olivia, a certified 2nd class archmage, so he was going to figure it out somehow.
It was not the time to worry about Gaold. Shirone is a suspect entangled with Gaold in some way, and she could end her life without being able to do anything.
There is no one who cares about Shirone’s well-being in the face of a world-class event called heaven.
It was a situation where I had to make my own judgment and find a way out.
‘Ikael… … .’
There is a reason to meet at least once after throwing away everything, but the situation was different from a year ago.
Even if he returns alive, he will become a traitor for the rest of his life and will not be able to escape being pursued.
Fortunately, Shirone still has the initiative.
After discovering the possibility of destroying Heaven, Gaold would classify Shirone as a key figure in the project, and if so, at least the foundation for survival would have been laid.
‘First of all, information collection comes first. We have to solve them one by one, as carefully as possible.’
Short-sighted thinking can be more effective if things get out of control and out of control.
It was best to solve the immediate problem by following it like a blind man.

===============================
[403] Final Decision (3)
After completing the battery implementation evaluation, Shirone headed to the restaurant with her friends.
Although I got a perfect score, there were quite a few sections where I felt uneasy, perhaps because I was disturbed.
As if my friends had already noticed, the atmosphere at the table was different from before.
Shirone was not in the mood to care about other people’s feelings.
When will you hear back from Gaold? No, even if they contacted me, what choice would I make?
Everything was just unsettling.
“Shirone, what are you worried about these days? The expression is not very good. Aren’t you sick?”
Amy put down the dishes and asked.
Even if it wasn’t Shirone, all the students were down, but today, their faces were so pale that they couldn’t bear to see them any more.
“are you okay. It’s just that I’m not feeling well.”
“Sometimes there are kids who can’t control their condition before the midterm. I was like that last year too. Hold on a little longer though. Vacation is coming soon.”
Shirone tried to smile.
As Amy, who has already experienced her senior year, she must be worried about herself shaking before the turning point of the 15th week.
“Shirone, water here.”
Maya personally poured water and handed it to Shirone.
It was pitiful to see him not eating properly and playing with his fork.
“Yeah, thank you.”
Shirone obediently accepted Maya’s favor.
When dealing with someone, it can be said that his attitude towards Maya was unusual because he measured the distance of the relationship before emotions.
Amy pouted her lower lip and watched as Shirone and Maya exchanged words.
Maya is a nice and bright child. That’s why she wouldn’t hurt getting to know Shirone.
But at the same time, I felt strangely uneasy.
Do you feel like you’ve been deprived of a place you didn’t even know you were?
Shirone asked while examining Maya’s plate.
“what? Maya, why aren’t you eating?”
“I ate it all. These days, I don’t go in as much as I used to.”
After the evaluation of occupying the high ground, Maya reduced the amount of food she ate.
To be precise, the original body has returned to the amount of food required.
Realizing that she had no talent for vocal music, Maya decided to enhance her sonic magic with her original voice, following Eruki’s advice.
You have to become a wizard, the primary goal, to have a future.
But more important than her career path was the aspiration in her heart.
I want to be loved by Shirone. I want to appear in front of him with a more beautiful appearance.
Just by not binge eating, Maya’s appearance became noticeably prettier.
As he lost weight in his face, his eyes became bigger and deeper, and the bridge of his nose also came alive.
His plentiful flesh had shrunk, and his clothes were loose, and his shoulder line came down to his arm.
Even the seniors couldn’t openly ignore Maya like they used to.
In a sense, it was bittersweet, but the human nature of giving power to beautiful things seemed helpless.
Nade and Eruki were also curious as they looked sideways at Maya’s changing appearance day by day.
‘Certainly a lot has changed. The faces you saw in picture books are gradually appearing.’
As such, the strange tension intensified.
Everyone knew that Emiya was a miser, but Maya was bad at hiding her emotions, so she fell for Shirone.
Amy suddenly raised her voice.
“Do you have rice now? Even today’s battery evaluation is okay. If I hadn’t been careful, I would have made a mistake on one issue. Class Two is the stage where you compete with Class One. If you make a mistake in the first half, it will be more difficult in the second half when your stamina is relatively low. Keep your mind straight and do it.”
Amy, who had already failed the graduation exam once, knew that now was the most important time.
Even if everyone is depressed about the Magic Association incident, they must face it with a firm sense of purpose.
It’s rice. It’s not like dying from starvation.
If you’re not alert now, you’re missing out on the biggest part of your life.
Amy hoped that Shirone would not regret it.
“Shirone, try eating this too.”
Maya cut Shirone’s favorite part of the meat so it was easy to eat and released it.
It was an act that revealed as if to block nagging, and there was actually a tearful side.
As the team grew closer, the question was whether Amy really loved Shirone.
Of course, Maya also wants Shirone to become a great wizard, but he thought that what a person who is stressed out with nightmares needs is not advice, but comfort.
‘It’s too much, Amy. If I were you, I would go crazy with happiness. I should be able to do anything Shirone asks me to do, but treat me carelessly like this.’
Shirone took the meat that Maya had given her and put it in her mouth.
I picked it because it was in the best condition to eat, but I didn’t even know who brought it.
My head felt like it was going to burst with all my thoughts.
Had Gaold met Alfeas?
If the NIS is caught, continuing the evaluation as it is could be dangerous.
Just as navigation does not guarantee the safety of students, it is foolish to be optimistic about entrusting one’s life to someone else.
Shirone put the tableware down.
Since Amy and Maya were in the middle of a war of nerves, Nade and Eruki flinched and looked back.
“sorry. I’ll go to the dorm first. I am very unwell.”
Maya got up right away, but Shirone left the restaurant without making eye contact with anyone.
Amy was just frustrated.
She knows that Shirone went to the Association. She is, so she wanted to tell me first.
Like when I went to heaven, like when I went to Kazura, like when I went to the old castle ruins, I wanted you to come to me first.
‘What’s the reason? Why didn’t you say anything this time?’
Maya looked at the door until Shirone left, then turned to Amy biting her upper lip.
There is no reason to hate Amy. What made her angry was the current situation where even her own feelings had to be approved by her.
Feeling Maya’s gaze, Amy raised her head. Then she hurriedly turned her head away.
When I felt a firmer determination than ever in Maya’s eyes, I thought that something had finally come.
“Amy, can you talk to me for a minute?”
Amy’s heart sank.
I thought it couldn’t be, but in a corner of my heart I knew that this time would definitely come, but when it came to me, I thought ‘just a little later’.
“Can’t we do it next time? I’m a bit busy today… … .”
“It only takes one minute. I’ll wait outside.”
As Maya walked away with the tray, Amy’s head went pale. But in the end, I got up from my seat with a bit of reason that the future will come.
Nade and Eruki shrugged as they watched Amy follow Maya as if possessed.
* * *
The book ‘Looking into the Darkness’, which was placed in the principal’s office library, went into the bookshelf by itself, tilted at 45 degrees.
The lock clicked with a thump from inside the closed library with the sound of gears turning.
A secret place designed by Alpheas long ago to store Erina’s memories.
But now, all of her belongings have been moved to the annex, and the room on the 3.5th floor is empty.
Alpheas and Olivia went down the stairs side by side.
Unlike Alpheas’s bitter smile, Olivia’s expression was fierce. Perhaps, she seemed nervous.
“It’s been a while, old man.”
Gaold, who was sitting cross-legged on the bare floor, raised a hand resting on his chin and said hello. Flu was guarding him.
“hello. My name is Fleur, a Certified Level 8 Wizard.”
“Long time no see, Fleur.”
Fleur lowered her gaze at Olivia’s greeting.
He has no shame in the face of the sky, but socially he appeared as a traitor, so he had no face to see his teacher.
‘I was a clever kid, but why did someone like Gaold… … .’
It was a child he had been keeping an eye on since he was the headmaster of the Royal Magic School.
But the bright road ahead was now blocked. No, he was a fugitive with no guarantee of a future life.
All of this is because of Gaold.
How many people can one lunatic tire out and disrupt society?
Gaold looked around curiously.
“This is the Panic Room that has been rumored. I didn’t know it would really exist, but anyway, the inspiration is also cunning.”
Alpheas omitted the gossip.
“Why did you come to see me?”
“this… … A disciple visited his alma mater, and it was a congratulatory order. Isn’t that too vulgar?”
“The school turned upside down because of you alone. Not a day goes by without agents coming in and destroying the school. If you had come just a few days sooner, everyone would have suffered.”
“Geuk, Alpheas of the world is finished. The gore that walks around here wouldn’t even know the agents came and went, and if they still had agents, they wouldn’t let me in.”
“You know that. So don’t ask me again. Why did you come to see me?”
Gaold sighed and exhaled.
If you had come to ask for a difficult favor, you would have to lower your stance, but this guy’s school didn’t go far.
“I’m thinking of going to Estas.”
“at last… … Are you saying you want to meet Miro?”
“Heuk, then I think you came to find something you left behind?”
“Gaold, your dogma is disturbing the world. Miro also doesn’t want to see you anymore. She took it all in and went in on her own.”
“How does the inspiration know that?”
Gaold’s eyes widened.
Flew, who sensed the denial of super fever, squinted one eye, but Gaold only changed his face in a frightening manner, but did not radiate any murderous spirit.
“You know how many times I have sent in goal the guys approaching Estas. Not a single person has been let in for 20 years, including me. But how do you know what Miro is thinking?”
“Gaold, Maze… … .”
“it’s okay. I will go into Eastas myself. Because we made it anyway. In fact, I have one more favor besides that, take care of me.”
Alpheas asked in a resigned voice.
“So, what kind of situation are you talking about?”
“As you know, my limbs are all cut off. I got them all from the association. Of course, the key factors remain intact, but you can’t do anything with your head alone. lend me someone Become a competent guy.”
No matter how good Gaold was, it was impossible to carry out all the operations alone.
A person with a powerful one-shot is also necessary, but a minimum party, such as a person who creates tactics, a person who uses it, and a person who supports them, must be equipped.
“You say you are at this school, the Bishop of the Karsis Monastery.”
Olivia came out in a fit of fuss.
“Do you think we will send our precious school personnel to limb? And what you’re about to do is against the survival of mankind. Rebellion is not enough, are you trying to disturb the world now?”
“You are shutting up.”
Gaold entered the room and saw Olivia face to face for the first time.
His stamina didn’t explode, but energy that seemed to pierce his body was emanating from his eyes alone.
“Do you know why I’m still keeping you alive? huh? Do you know! Please answer me.”
Olivia kept her mouth shut and glared fiercely.
“Because it’s not worth killing.”
The sound of grinding teeth came from Gaold’s mouth.
“abstention? A person from the Teachers’ Association, a student from the Kingdom, seems to be dragged into the dimension of cowardice, but what, renunciation? Do you know what they say about someone like you? dissembler. You don’t like this or that, you have one of twenty cards that can determine the survival of mankind, and the only thing you choose is to give up?”
Olivia’s lips trembled. The gaze that had been glaring at Gaold slowly descended.
“Oh, it was inevitable.”
Whatever the choice, it wasn’t the result Olivia was hoping for. No, actually, that thought was an excuse.
It was just scary. He was so terrified that he couldn’t choose anything.
Transparent tears formed in Olivia’s eyes, vividly feeling the sense of helplessness at the time.
Gaold turned away with an embarrassed expression.
She is a second-class wizard recognized by the world, but in the end, she couldn’t even shed her skin. That’s why she is only a 2nd class Grand Wizard.
‘This is why I didn’t want to come to school.’
It’s all about the past here.
A past that cannot be erased no matter how much you erase it.
Gaold couldn’t even remember what happened an hour ago, but the scenery reflected in his eyes on the Day of Judgment of the 20 People could clearly recall even the feelers of insects attached to leaves.
“ha.”
Gaold looked back at Alfeas.
It was a very human expression that probably everyone who knew him would have seen for the first time.
“Help me, please. Master.”
“… … .”
There was a day called the 20 Judges.
The day when 20 people representing the world and Miro’s position gathered to decide the future of mankind.
The result was 16 votes in favor, 1 vote against, and 3 abstentions.
There was only one person, Mirhi Alfeas, who valued one life more than the lives of all mankind.
The only one on Gaold’s side, he gladly carved opposition into his cards.
“You know. I don’t trust anyone but Master. Help me. You have to find the maze. It’s not even dead. He’s still alive there, so why the hell are you not looking for him?”
Alpheas was immersed in anguish.
Perhaps Olivia’s choice in the Judgment of the 20 was the most rational decision that Sun could make.
But he knew how it felt when a precious person who could not be replaced with anything in the world disappeared right in front of his eyes.
It is not a choice made for the sake of the world. Alpheas was also an inescapable madman.
“Dear Ethella… … I beg you.”
Perhaps Ethella would give permission.
The Bishop of the Karsis Monastery and the immediate successor of the Yin-Yang Wave Fist.
If he hadn’t humbled his body and mind with the conviction of one thought and three thousand, he would not have the talent to be in the current position.
It was enough wood for Gaold to use.
“Stay here for a while. The agents will be taken care of by me and Olivia. Let’s get ready to open Eastas.”
When Alpheas turned around with a tired face, Gaold finally regained his smile.
Then, as if thinking about it, I raised my hand.
“Oh, wait.”
Alpheas turned around in front of the stairs.
“Since you asked for it, invite just one more person.”

Chapter - 404 - Final Decision (4) 3.txt
===============================
[404] Final Decision (4)
Team Shirone gathered at the park for the first time in a while and discussed their schedule during vacation.
If the second half of the senior year is going to be more intense than the first half, it was better to set up a strategy in preparation for it from now on.
“Last year, I practiced alone, but I found out that there are some kids who form a team and do it. So, we thought it would be a good idea to form a group and do camp training.”
It was a part that could not be easily thought of unless it was Amy who went through the senior year, so her friends were also reviewing it positively.
Eruki raised his finger and said as if there was one thing that bothered him.
“Of course, students with a team have an advantage when it comes to occupying a hill or interpersonal combat. But do you know After all, only 10 passers-by. Even if we team up, we still have to compete with each other to make it to the final 10. In short, how far should information be shared?”
If you have a trump card ready, it’s natural to want to save it until the graduation exam.
If it was a two-person team, it would be close to a miracle for all five to pass, so it was an issue that had to be addressed clearly.
It wasn’t something that Amy didn’t know about either.
“I thought so too until last year. But you don’t have to use all the vacation days. First of all, we can gather together and focus on basic training, and then study the special moves alone.”
Amy emphasized that strengthening teamwork might increase the passing rate rather than studying special moves.
The reason is that the one who controls the current senior class is Fermi, and Shirone and his party are all stamped by him.
Since it was not known what would happen on the day of the graduation exam, the only way to reduce variables was to stick together.
“I think Amy is right.”
Nade unconditionally agreed.
Actually, the graduation exam was okay, but it was thousands of times more fun to train with friends than to endure months in a terrible hometown.
“How about doing this? Let’s do a short-term training camp for about a month, but let’s borrow the senior class system. We set goals for each day and score each other.”
Eruki nodded as if he understood.
“You mean to keep up with the senior class routine. that’s a good way In a short amount of time, you can increase your achievement level, and in the remaining time, you can practice your own special moves.”
Even while various opinions were presented, Shirone kept her mouth shut. He just kept his friends’ faces in his eyes one by one.
Nothing has been decided yet, but the feeling is strange.
If I had to think of something in the last moments of my life, it would be the faces of my friends gathered here right now.
“huh? Maya, where are you sick?”
Shirone looked back at Maya for the last time and asked back in surprise.
Maya’s complexion was not good. Her face was frightened pale, and her chest was rising and falling wildly as if she was having trouble breathing.
Nade, who belatedly discovered Maya’s condition, asked anxiously.
“Are you okay, Maya? Shall I take you to the infirmary?”
Maya quickly shook her head.
Then, as if he had come back from amnesia, he raised his head and looked back at Shirone.
“Shirone.”
“huh?”
“love you.”
Silence fell on the park bench.
Nade opened his mouth, and Eruki quickly blinked. Amy was the only one waiting for Shirone’s reaction with a calm expression.
Shirone glared at Maya and swallowed.
It wasn’t a joke this time. Her emotions, which had fallen like drops of water every day, formed a lake in her heart before she knew it.
“Uh, there… … Shall we get out of the way?”
Maya shook her head again and said.
“I didn’t think I would be able to summon up the courage twice, so I wanted to say it in front of everyone. I’m sorry, Shirone. but i fell in love with you Please accept my heart.”
Maya took out a stationery from her pocket. It smelled like flowers.
“Can you read it?”
After delivering the letter to Shirone, she averted everyone’s gaze and got up from the bench.
“I will hear the answer then.”
Nade looked at Amy as Maya left, leaving behind unknown words. Even in this situation, it was still a poker face that was not disturbed.
Amy walked behind the bench and peeked out from over Shirone’s shoulder.
“Envy you. Get a confession from a woman. What is written on it?”
It would be rude to return Maya’s heartfelt letter.
However, considering the delicate relationship between Shirone and Amy, it was a problem that could not be said to be absolutely necessary.
When Shirone hesitated, Amy smiled and tapped her on the shoulder.
“It’s a joke. what’s so serious You knew Maya liked you.”
“No, it’s too sudden… … .”
“Go to your room and read it to yourself. Read it two or three times. Then you can do whatever you want. Maya is a good kid. I’ll go first. I’ll see you tomorrow. hi.”
Amy sighed and left without a moment to catch her breath.
It was only his face that was calm, but his voice was angry, and his behavior was awkward.
“Hey, what are you going to do? Is there anyone who has decided?”
Shirone held the stationery and looked into the distance.
Amy and Maya. They are so good that you can’t even think of hurting anyone.
‘Now I have to make a decision.’
Maybe Maya’s confession was a good thing.
Heaven or humanity, I wondered if it was something that had to be sorted out first before discussing such grandiose issues.
“Nade, Eruki. I have a favor to ask you.”
* * *
afternoon the next day.
Shirone entered the principal’s office.
Alpheas silently pointed to the library and opened the secret door.
When I went down the stairs to my room, the expected and unexpected people were waiting for me.
The former were Gaold and Fleur, the latter Ethella and Siena.
“teacher?”
“You’re here, Shirone.”
Siena’s face didn’t look good.
As I had heard everything about the existence and danger of heaven, and the people involved in the dark side of this incident, I couldn’t help but feel it.
Shirone realized why Gaold had come to Alpheas.
Now that his limbs have been amputated, there are not many people he can turn to for help. If he was a teacher at Alfeas Magic School, he would have enough power.
“You must have had a hard time alone. Now the teachers will protect you, so don’t worry too much.”
Ethella, the Bishop of the Monastery of Karsis, would not fail to take action in the face of the fate of mankind, but Siena’s decision this time was solely for Shirone’s sake.
There is no room to reveal Shirone’s life, feelings, or dignity in a world-scale event. With the heart of a teacher who only cares about the safety of her students, Siena willingly chose to go to heaven.
“teacher… … .”
Was it sad without realizing it?
Days of nightmares, fearing that his life would be destroyed by a sudden incident and worrying that he might be caught and sentenced to death by the NIS, passed by like a kaleidoscope.
“Are you here? Called to share all information as per the terms of the contract. Open Eastas today and meet Maze. It will be impossible to have a conversation in samadhi, but it is something you must check before going to heaven.”
Gaold’s voice reminded me.
This is the first reunion with Miro in 20 years. She also knew that it could be her last day seeing her.
“But can we go on like this? I don’t know if there are still agents left.”
The NIS set up barricades around Estas and searched the warehouse to find the ‘upper level’, which is said to contain the space-time of the maze.
Although he made a fuss and turned away, the possibility that he was still hiding could not be ruled out.
“Hey, it’s okay. In the yard that came this far, it doesn’t matter, right?”
Gaold left the room proudly.
When the wizard known to be the strongest in Tormia acted as if there was no problem, others followed without a sound.
After crossing the barricade of Estas, ninety-eight warehouses were scattered like dismantled blocks. Operation was stopped at the highest level of isolation.
“Nothing has changed here.”
Gaold opened the lid of the Istas’ instrument panel.
At that time when my hands were wandering because I didn’t know which one to touch first, 10 National Intelligence Service agents came out from the back of the building.
“Mikea Gaold, under the Kingdom Security Law, you are arrested for treason.”
Shirone hurriedly prepared for battle.
When his fears became reality, he realized how foolish he had been in following Gaold.
It was overlooked that even a first-class archmage was basically insane.
How could he have left such an easy judgment to Gaold? As if possessed by something.
Gaold wasn’t even looking at the agents, he was examining the instrument panel.
“Hmm, how did you manipulate this? Hey, was it the red button?”
A cold voice came from behind the agents.
“It’s the blue button, you idiot.”
The agents split left and right and a man walked out.
The moment she looked at him, Shirone felt goosebumps all over her body.
All Baek’s hair had no eyebrows, and her thin, thin lips were indistinguishable from her skin.
Most bizarre were his amber eyes. The irises were ticking like the gears of a clock.
“Ah, right, it was blue, right? As I get older, I keep blinking.”
The man ignored Gaold’s words and walked towards Alfeas. Then, in what seemed like a perfect isokinetic motion, he bent his back.
“How are you, Headmaster?”
“okay. It’s been a while, Sein.”
“Se, Sein?”
Only then did Shirone look away from the agents.
One of the first members of the Supernatural Psychic Research Society that Gaold had mentioned before. He was also the creator of the Master Equation of Istas.
Ethella gently put Shirone on the shoulder and pointed at the agents.
“Shirone, look at them with synesthesia.”
Following Ethella’s instructions, Sain’s Spirit Zone split into tentacles, and he could feel that he was connected to all the NIS agents.
“Mind control?”
“that’s right. That is the highest level of mind control.”
If they came from the NIS, the force of the agents would be more than average. Also, due to the nature of the job, it had to be seen that there was resistance training in the mental system.
A person who succeeded in mind control on such people with 100% probability.
I’ve heard from Arin that in order to be able to do that, concentration equivalent to 20 times the opponent’s mental strength is required.
Estas started to hum.
Gaold released his hand from the blue button and introduced Sein to Shirone, still looking at the instrument panel. This was also included in the contract.
“Sain is a Servant and a spirit-type mage. He currently works under the pseudonym Snake in Black Line. After all, he’s a red-lined triple-A offender. Get your autograph.”
“A black line?”
Shirone glanced sideways at Sein with an uneasy expression.
The Black Line is a group of people who deny the taboos of magic and use magic only out of personal conviction.
It is different from simply killing and harassing people.
It can be seen just by looking at the fact that even Arcane, the villain of the world, was located at the end of the red line spectrum.
Arius of the 7 Magical Girls, who illegally infiltrates the human mind and steals intellectual property, is classified as a risk factor that can collapse the social system.
“Usually, in the Black Line, if I were to pick the strongest spirit type, I would pick two people. One is Madou 7 Girls’ Kitaruman, and Snake. Our team will take the order. Of course, I am the commander.”
Sein snorted.
“The bullshit is still there. Did you really become an idiot for playing house in the association? The reason a guy like you can even imitate a commander is because my orders are accurate.”
‘He has a similar personality to Eruki… … .’
Shirone saw Eruki’s arrogance in Sein.
I thought that if I lived with superhuman calculation ability, my confidence in myself would peak like that.

Chapter - 405 - Final Decision (5) 1.txt
===============================
[405] Final Decision (5)
“Get out of the way. It is still mechanical.”
Sein pushed Gaold’s chest away and inspected the instrument panel.
Seeing the former head of the Magic Association being pushed around by someone was an extremely unfamiliar sight to Shirone.
However, Shirone’s eyes soon became immersed in nostalgia.
‘Oh, I see.’
Nade and Eruki.
If Shirone finds herself in a maze-like situation, what will the two of them look like decades later?
Gaold, Miro, and Sein, the first members of the Supernatural Psychic Science Research Society, were caught up in the most terrible incident in the world.
Even though 20 years have passed and their paths have completely diverged, their time still stands still.
Gaold raised his middle finger against the back of Sain’s head.
It seemed inevitable that even the world-renowned archmage would become childish when alumni met each other.
Unable to let go of his lingering feelings, he glanced at the instrument panel over Sein’s shoulder.
However, to him, a machine was just an unknown object that worked when irons were attached to it and chanted.
Then he laughed wickedly, as if he had suddenly had a funny idea.
“Hey, you know what? Putting mind magic on a national intelligence agent is the death penalty. If you want to live a long time, you better be eager for me to return to work.”
Saein said while quickly manipulating the instrument panel.
“What do you know about the laws of the red line, you idiot. I can’t remember what happened here as long as I’m mentally controlled. It looks pretty uneasy, should I just bury them alive?”
Ethella frowned.
As the Bishop of the Karsis Monastery, it was only natural that he could not tolerate the black line wizard who was making the world turbid.
But she took no action. Because she believes in Alfeas.
Even if it was because of a cherished disciple’s earnest request, he was not the one to ask for a mission to break the Karsis Monastery’s beliefs.
‘He must have meant something.’
When she heard the story of Heaven, the first thought that came to her mind was that nothing should be judged.
It is not a matter so light that it can be evaluated based on individual beliefs.
The only thing that moved her was the sense of mission to see with her own eyes the whole story of a huge flow that must have started 20 years ago, or even longer.
Sein entered the master mode of Istas.
As green letters flashed on the panel, I quickly entered information by combining several symbols.
Siena, who had been waiting patiently, asked without suppressing her curiosity.
“By the way, did the Upper Eastas really exist? I know that even the intelligence agents of the NIS returned without finding anything.”
“The upper level exists. There’s just no way to get in. It was designed that way from the beginning. Even I, who analyzed all the patterns of Istas, made it inaccessible.”
Shirone looked around at the warehouses scattered everywhere.
I wondered if an inaccessible room could exist when all the warehouses had already been individually dismantled.
“How is that possible? In fact, you can enter any warehouse now. That’s why Sain also made the master key for Estas.”
Sain came here and observed Shirone closely for the first time.
I knew that I belonged to the project from the moment Gaold introduced me with special care, but no matter how I look at it, I was just a soft kid.
“How do you know the master key?”
“I am a member of the Supernatural Psychic Research Society. Among my friends, there is a Servant, and that friend was like that. The Master Equation of Istas could not be made more beautiful no matter who touches it.”
Sein didn’t laugh. But the explanation was more detailed.
“Perhaps. It is an equation that equates a complex 4-dimensional diagram to a 3-dimensional one.”
The mathematical elimination of one dimension can be compared to the difficulty of making ants understand human language. That’s why anyone can find a research society with a master equation.
A map that has a three-dimensional shape but actually finds four-dimensional coordinates.
“Upper floors are not limited to space.”
Sein nodded.
Shirone’s insight was quite good, but if he couldn’t achieve this level, he was not qualified to participate in Gaold’s project in the first place.
“okay. In three dimensions, Istas is just a warehouse made up of 89 buildings. But the upper level is on a higher level than that. That’s why the agents couldn’t find it.”
“In addition to a specific space, do you mean that a specific time has to coincide?”
“That’s right. Taking the 333 cube as an example, when the cube at coordinates 1. 1. 1 is moved to coordinates 3. 1. 3, what changes is time in addition to space. No matter how fast you turn it, it takes 0.1 seconds. This is called space-time. I came up with this idea and found a way that no one could approach the maze. It is to hide the space-time of the maze at the origin of the cube.”
Suddenly, everyone was listening to Sein.
Even Alpheas, who had once been Sein’s teacher, was now in a position to learn after 20 years.
“No matter how the cube is rotated, in other words, no matter how the pattern of Istas is changed, the cube’s space-time origin never moves, so the upper layers can also be completely concealed. What you created to calculate this is the Master Equation of Eastas, which you are currently using.”
Saliva ran down Shirone’s throat.
I didn’t expect that there was such a serious reason for the Master Equation, which I thought was nothing more than a prank of a study group in the dark.
Siena said.
“But aren’t we gathered today to go to the upper levels? If no one can get in, what are you waiting for here?”
“Another master key.”
As if that word had become a keyword, I heard the sound of electricity exploding as I gripped the empty lot. It was a noise peculiar to flicker magic that even Shirone was familiar with.
It was a pair of men and women that appeared through the scale magician’s proprietary patent.
The woman was short and petite with permed bobbed hair and gave a cute impression, while the man was tall and had blonde hair hanging down to his waist.
The important thing is that both of them are old acquaintances with Shirone. maybe.
If no two people could be the same in the world, then the blonde man with bandages over his eyes couldn’t be a different person.
The Eternal Reflector, Armin of the Gwangan, was walking.
“Oh, brother?”
Siena couldn’t believe what she was seeing.
Why is Armin, who should be wandering the world and capturing landscapes on canvas, at the center of the worst human situation?
“Jung, are you really Armin’s brother?”
Siena approached, but Armin coldly turned away from her and moved on.
His wife, Keira, also headed for Estas without even giving a glance.
Siena froze in place as if shocked. Her mind was twisted and she couldn’t think of anything.
“You arrived on time. Really, was that rude to the world’s greatest time mage?”
World’s greatest time wizard.
Being a magician who conquered the speed of light, Shirone did not find the title awkward at all. However, Siena, who knew nothing about him, only deepened his embarrassment.
“A time wizard. What the hell are you talking about, brother?”
Armin was silent until the end.
Sein, who decided that confusion is not good ahead of the event, introduced Armin. It was ironic to Siena, who thought she knew Armin best.
“In order to reach the upper levels of Istas, you will definitely need the help of a powerful time mage. Armin of Gwangan couldn’t be more qualified than this.”
Siena shook her head.
The more I listened to the explanation, the more confused I was.
“Keira, how the hell did this happen! Are you kidding me?”
Keira, who always had a lively smile and sometimes said nasty things, but this time she didn’t laugh.
He raised his voice high-handedly, lowering his eyes so coldly that he wondered if it was the same person.
“You’re going to be careful with your words, Mr. Oleifer Siena. We are Armin and Keira, wizards of the Ivory Tower Human Security Enforcement Department, belonging to the White Line.”
“The White Line… … .”
Shirone, who knew Armin’s identity, couldn’t help but be surprised this time.
If there are associations on the red line and factions on the black line, the white line is a completely independent institution that only ends up in an ivory tower.
Magic that is not abused in the world.
Purity not swayed by the ruler’s beliefs.
The wizards of the Ivory Tower, whose motto are these two, only pursue the extremes of pure magic.
It is said that even ordinary staff are equivalent to a country’s great wizard, and their military power is not at a level that any one kingdom can surpass.
He is the absolute monarch of the sorcerer society, where even the royal family trembles when he holds his certificate of belonging to the Ivory Tower.
But Armin is here as a member of the Ivory Tower.
As a wizard of the Human Security Enforcement Department.
Ivory Tower wizards do not discriminate between departments, but it is true that from the perspective of the Red Line, the Human Security Enforcement Department, which has little to do with society, notices the most.
In fact, it was a famous anecdote that 32 years ago, when Igor, the dictator of the Kingdom of Korn, reached out to necromancy, a wizard from the Human Security Enforcement Department came in alone and made him kneel down and crawl to the floor.
Keira walked up to Gaold and pressed her face.
Armin had no choice but to come because he was stubborn, but if he had already done his job, shouldn’t he have taken care of his business?
Armin was a person far from real life.
“Since you brought Armin, you should also keep your promise. First, the Ivory Tower has the right to record and disseminate information obtained from the construction of the maze. Second, it forbids Olifer Siena from going to heaven. You know that Armin came here because of the second clause, right?”
“of course. But let’s make one thing clear. It was only if Siena agreed. I really hate convincing people. Especially if you are a woman.”
“Well, it’s okay. Because Armin knows that. But later you have to tell Armin that I have definitely imprinted the second point on you.”
“Hehe, you live a really difficult life too.”
When Keira said it, she frowned as if asking what she was doing.
Stubborn Armin.
In fact, the Ivory Tower has yet to make any judgments about heaven. This is because it is still seen as a problem that can be sufficiently solved in human society.
But Armin fell for Gaold’s trick.
In order to open the upper floors of Istas, the highest level time mage was needed, and Gaold, who tried to recapture the labyrinth, could not have been unaware of his existence.
The result obtained after investigating Armin’s whereabouts was the same reason why the Ivory Tower was able to capture Armin.
Olifer Siena.
A woman who is so precious to Armin that he could even exchange his life for it.
That’s why Keira hated Siena even more.
‘Sheesh, is that girl that good? She’s a girl who doesn’t have any charms.’
When Sein released the mind control, the 10 agents collapsed to the ground like puppets with a string cut off. It was to make sure that there was no variable in activating his thoughts right before the gigantic event.
“Finish it before the agents come to their senses. I will go right in.”
Sain pressed the button on the instrument panel along with the horse.
The 89 warehouses began to mesh in a specific form.
For this moment, Shirone put aside her thoughts of Armin and looked at Estas.
A time mage belonging to the Ivory Tower of the white line, a first-class great mage of the red line, and a top-notch spirit-type mage of the black line.
At the gathering of the three great wizards who reached their peak in different fields, the upper floors of Istas were about to be opened for the first time in 20 years.

[406] Final Decision (6)
Kurleung. thump.
The buildings of Istas piled up one by one and turned into a huge mass-shaped structure. It was like a giant with two thick legs rooted in the ground.
Sein, who opened the warehouse on the giant’s right leg, spoke to Alfeas.
“If we go in, please activate the Estas again.”
Those who do not go to heaven are not qualified to confirm the time-space of the labyrinth.
At least Alpheas thought so, and intended to do what he could.
“Let’s begin.”
The mischief was gone from Gaold’s face.
We finally meet Miro.
It was rather fortunate that she fell into samadhi. The anger I’ve been keeping for 20 years might shake.
After everyone entered the warehouse, Alfeas restarted the Istas.
Following the pattern set by Sein, the cube-shaped buildings began to repeat the intricate combination and separation.
thud. coo kung. thud.
I can hear the heartbeat of Istas.
With every step he took, Sein’s amber irises ticked.
The left iris flicked left and right at an angle of 15 degrees, and only the right iris rotated with different accelerations for each section.
Sain changed his stride length instead of maintaining his walking speed. It was a way to control time by controlling space.
“Come this way.”
When Sein opened the door, turning at a right angle from the center of the warehouse, another warehouse came up and the door was connected to the passage.
As soon as you cross the boundary, the warehouse you were staying in before will fall down and you will be overtaken by another block and away from you.
This process was repeated countless times.
‘tremendous. I can’t even imitate him unless I’m a Servant.’
The warehouse moves, the world moves, and time moves.
It felt like the concept of space that I knew before was collapsing. Shirone was really walking in 4D time and space.
As Sein’s steps stopped in front of the final destination, Shirone’s eyes filled with vague emotions.
Supernatural Psychic Research Society
A nostalgic sign was hung.
The crooked signboard that always puts it back to its original place but tilts on its own as if ignoring its balance.
When the door was opened, traces of the agent’s stumbling were still there.
The equations written by Eruki on the blackboard were erased here and there, and the picture books that Nade had been reluctant to throw away were left torn to shreds.
Sain walked to the sofa.
“The supernatural psychic science research society in 12 seconds to arrive in the future. In that space-time coordinate, there is the upper layer of Istas. From now on, Armin, it’s your turn.”
Armin walked past Sein and stepped forward.
As a scale wizard who handles time and space, he knew what the upper layer of Istas was without explanation.
“Seven seconds. 6 seconds. 5 seconds.”
As Sain started counting, he heard a strong wind noise, as if caught in a storm current.
It was a phenomenon that occurred as the coordinates of space and time with the upper layer approached them.
The articles of the research society were melted and blurred by the air density of the strong wind, and on the table in front of the sofa, a stone gate similar to the Guffin’s door I saw in Galliant was overlapping as an afterimage.
Woo woo woo!
“Four seconds. three seconds.”
As time passed, the scenery became more paler, and on the contrary, the color of the stone gate came back vividly.
The objects flickered and then became transparent in the space-time coordinates moving away.
“Two seconds. one second.”
The moment when all the scenery disappears and only the shape of the stone gate reaches 100% materialization.
“Now.”
Armin casts a spell.
stop.
“oh my god… … .”
Siena’s eyes lit up.
The feeling of acceptance was not different between Etel and Shirone.
The upper part of Istas, which was hiding in a specific space and at a specific time, was caught by the stop magic and revealed itself.
20 years ago, a genius girl who surprised the world appeared. And mankind imprisoned the girl in a certain coordinate in time and space that no one can find.
This was the truth of the upper echelons of Istas, which had only been rumored at Alpheas Magic School.
‘It must have been something like this.’
Shirone finally understood Sein’s words.
the origin of the cube. A place that countless agents could not find even after searching.
Armin said as he turned away from the stone gate.
“As long as time is stopped, the door will remain. But you’d better do it as soon as possible. If the situation comes when the magic is dispelled, you will be trapped in the labyrinth of time and space.”
It seemed that such a situation would never happen, but since it was a life-threatening matter, there was nothing wrong with being cautious.
Shirone had also escaped from the space-time of the maze before, but it was possible because he was an Unlocker.
Besides, Miro couldn’t even ask for her help as he was currently in a state of samadhi.
Gaold didn’t think about the problems that followed.
The name of the first-class archmage was colorless, and his heart was pounding, and his face was more flushed than ever.
“Let’s go, Sein.”
“hmm.”
The irises of Sain who followed were also rotating in the opposite direction.
A phenomenon that occurs when coolness and excitement work simultaneously.
The reason he was able to rise to the ranks of the strongest in anti-magic was because he perfectly separated emotions and reason like this.
“Did you say Shirone? You better do it.”
The door to the upper floors was supposed to be unsealed through the Immortal Function, like the Guffin’s door.
Anyway, there are two unlockers on the team. However, it was better for Armin to focus on the stop magic, so it was up to Shirone to open it up.
When Shirone opened the immortal function, the letters on the stone gate glowed, then disintegrated into small cubes and spread in the form of spheres.
As the material melted, a massive black hole was created.
“excuse me… … Who goes in first?”
I don’t know why, but I felt like I had to set an order for some reason.
It doesn’t matter right now, but it could be interpreted as a meaningful event in history in the future.
“It would be right for the person who broke the seal to enter. Shirone, you are the first to enter.”
Armin pushed Shirone with a friendly smile.
Siena’s mind became complicated as she watched the scene. I felt like I couldn’t even remember who Armin was.
“Then I’ll go in.”
For a moment, the vision darkened, and then the view from the center of the huge temple unfolded.
The scenery with the two-kilometer-high pillars supporting the ceiling was undoubtedly a labyrinth of time and space.
‘I never thought I would come here again.’
One by one, people came over from the black hole.
Just like when Shirone first came here, everyone seemed to be at a loss for words at the temple on a scale beyond human common sense.
“what? however… … .”
Shirone hurriedly turned around. He was looking around everyone to see if he had the same idea.
“What, what happened?”
The maze was not visible.
“Shirone, maybe here… … .”
“no. It is a construction of a maze. It’s no different from when I came a year ago.”
Gaold cast fly magic.
With a pop, his body flew rapidly from end to end of the temple.
It was a ‘jet’-type magic that flew by exploding air pressure, rather than maneuvering by lift.
Gaold quickly moved around the vast temple.
It had a flight similar to the Shirone’s wings, but the level of movement was different.
Returning to his seat, Gaold’s face began to contort terribly. It seemed that superheated hell would unfold at any moment.
“These damn bastards… … .”
“calm down. Nothing happened yet. It’s just that there is no labyrinth in the labyrinth’s space-time.”
There is no labyrinth in the space-time of the labyrinth.
It’s true that there isn’t, but it’s something that could never happen.
First of all, there is no existence that can enter and exit the space-time of the maze. Also, if you are in a state of samadhi, it is impossible to escape on your own.
No, if that was possible in the first place, there would be no reason for Garold to wait 20 years.
“It’s hijacking.”
Sein concluded like that.
“Perhaps they kidnapped Miro from heaven.”
Gaold asked.
“Is that possible? Not even one molecule has ever come over from Heaven.”
“No, there is.”
Armin bent down to pick up debris from the floor.
It was a piece of stone that collapsed from the ceiling when an impact was applied to the space-time of the maze.
Rubbing his fingers to check the material, he said.
“I heard that there was a crack in the labyrinth’s time-space not too long ago. The ruler of the law also came to Tormia Kingdom. I know it was handled and reported by the mage of the Akeanis Shrine.”
“But it’s only a mental body. If you want to kidnap an entire human being, it’s nothing more than a crack.”
“The ivory tower is of the same opinion. However, it is human thinking. Heaven, especially the archangels, may have found a special way.”
Sein put his chin on his head and asked himself.
“Why did you take Miro with you?”
It was an odd question at first glance.
This is because Heaven is planning a final war, and it has consistently expressed its intention to infiltrate ever since the creation of the labyrinth’s space-time.
Shirone asked.
“Of course he did it to invade this world, right?”
Ethella said.
“no. Maybe that’s impossible.”
Sein agreed.
“Just taking Maze has no effect. Even if you kill the maze, the maze’s space-time won’t be destroyed.”
Shirone asked with a puzzled expression.
“Indestructible?”
“The space-time of the maze is basically a dimension based on cowardice. It keeps creating new dimensions within dimensions. Using that infinity, it creates a boundary between space and time. And Miro further increased the speed of the attack through Sammaegyeong. The theory is that even if the maze dies, the inertia of samadhi-gyeong continues to strengthen the space-time of the maze. Of course I can’t understand it.”
As you move into the mental world after death, the control of your consciousness weakens and you are affected by the most intense inertia of your life.
It was for this reason that even if the Virtual Zone was turned off, if it could not escape from fear, it would be buried in the mind forever.
“no. I think I know.”
Sein didn’t even snort.
“It is just an illusion. The illusion of a beginner who thinks he has realized his true intentions by understanding the context.”
How many people in this world fully understand the space-time of the maze?
Even if he didn’t know, it was not applicable to a kid who went to a magic school.
Siena said.
“Shirone has passed the cowardice.”
Sain’s eyebrow muscles twitched. It was the greatest surprise he could express.
At Alpheas Magic School, the only person who passed the cowardice was Miro. Even at that time, the memory of the uproar about the appearance of a world-class genius was vivid in my head.
‘Hmm. Indeed, Gaold deserves it.’
Gaold put it simply.
“Anyway, they can’t kill Maze. Even so, taking him must have found a way. It’s not a lot of time. As soon as the team is in order, we will go to heaven.”
Sein did not disagree. He was the one who walked through the black line for 20 years for what he is today.
‘but… … Is this normal?’
The feeling was strange.
It was literally a feeling.
Is the result of today, which has occurred now, just an unfortunate situation that can happen to anyone, with really small coincidences overlapping?
If so, what is the identity of this unpleasant feeling of incongruity that haunts your mind?
An extremely irrational thought that if things were going to turn out this way, they should have been twisted somehow over the course of 19 years.
‘Why now? No, why is this happening? Is it normal for me to think like this? Anyway, the world doesn’t go the way you want it to. Attributing transcendent meaning to chance is no different from superstition.’
I wanted to draw that conclusion.
But Sein couldn’t shake it off in the end.
It’s not an illogical thought. Rather, it is a subtle intrusiveness that occurs in the realm of intuition that transcends logic.
‘For sure… … .’
Something was out of place.

Chapter - 407 - Final Decision (7) 4.txt
===============================
[407] Final Decision (7)
The party left the maze of time and space and gathered in the secret room of Alpheas.
Gaold was sitting cross-legged, his hands resting on his knees, lost in thought.
Not being able to see the maze was disappointing, but that wasn’t the point right away.
“The final war may come sooner than expected. Then we should move faster. Gangnan will be coming to Galliant. One more person may or may not come, but now is the time to make a choice.”
Gaold said to Shirone.
“If the final war breaks out, the one who fights against the enemy will be the hero. But if you follow us now, you will become a traitor who hastened the final war.”
Whether it was a hero or a traitor, it didn’t matter to Shirone.
If it was an operation carried out by someone as skilled as Gaold risking his life, the chance of Shirone’s survival would be less than 1 percent.
“If you give me time, how long can you give me?”
“We are leaving for Galliant tonight. Of course, I will wait until the Gangnan comes, but it won’t exceed 2 days at the most. If you decide to go to heaven, come to Galliant. Because inspiration will take care of school problems. Well, on the way to die, what use would that be?”
Gaold was not afraid to take risks.
I need Shirone’s ability, but if I’m going to attack with a clumsy resolution, I’d rather not be on the team.
If you take a frightened kid with you, you won’t be able to do anything and you’ll be annihilated.
Armin took a step closer to Gaold.
Even after confirming the construction of the maze, the reason they followed it was to fulfill the contract.
“Siena does not go to heaven.”
“Ah, that was a contract. good. Siena, you can’t go to heaven. Get out of the team as of this time.”
Siena shook her head.
If Armin had come for that reason, and if the reason Gaold had invited him was only that, it would have hurt his pride as a certified 5th class wizard.
“Why should I follow someone else’s opinion and not the team? I will go to heaven.”
“You say so? With this, the contract is over.”
Light emanated from within Armin’s bandages.
Keira gulped down her saliva as the blade raged.
“I am not in the mood to joke. You’d better fulfill the contract properly. If you want to go to heaven in good condition.”
The reason Siena revealed her identity even though she knew she would be hurt was only to prevent her from going to heaven.
Rescuing the maze? It’s bullshit.
Armin of the Human Security Enforcement Department knows Heaven’s armed forces better than anyone else.
Gaold is a special type of Red Line 1st class that specializes only in combat, but even if he tried with all his might, it was questionable whether he would be able to deal with an ordinary angel, let alone an archangel.
Of course, it’s not impossible.
There are no absolutes in battle, and if even a tiny variable is snowballed, you might be able to defeat it with strategy and tactics.
But the enemies of heaven are unlike anything in the human world.
In the event of a collision in the absence of information, the winner is determined simply by the logic of force.
That’s why the Ivory Tower, as well as the Temple, is focusing on postponing the final war until as much information as possible is secured.
Gaold replied nonchalantly.
“What are you talking about? I don’t ask for favors. Because I’m not a parasitic brother like you. Even if I don’t take her, Siena will come to heaven on her own.”
Blood pooled in Armin’s temples.
“Take it in moderation, Gaold. If you want to die, go and die alone. Your madness is only a nuisance to the world.”
“Ah, sorry for bothering you. But do you know what really pisses me off? Why do you ignore the troubles the world has caused me when you say such things? I was the only one who suffered, but you are suffering because the whole of humanity shares it, so don’t whine too much. Listening to it makes me feel dirty.”
Armin snorted.
“A nuisance the world has brought upon you? No, you’re just a madman obsessed with ugly desires. Can you really say Miro didn’t have a choice? Judgment Day for the 20… … .”
“What do you know?”
Gaold’s face turned pale.
The flames were burning in the two wide-open eyes.
“you… … What do you know about mazes?”
“Hee!”
Fleur closed her eyes.
Undoubtedly, the screeching sound of the preta exploded as the superheat hell encroached on the borders of the space.
Even the teachers shuddered in agony as the emotions of pain Gaold experienced spread beyond the physical body.
It was a self-denial that would drive a normal person crazy.
Armin’s nose twitched.
As the light’s eyes flashed eeriely, the phenomenon of the flames stopping from Armin’s back rushed over to Gaold.
From the center of the place where the two stood, the two worlds of fire and eternity collided.
“Don’t do anything stupid. Don’t think you’re the only one experiencing hell. It is the last warning. Promise me you won’t take Siena with you.”
“Hey, now I know. You are just a lump of blood that knows nothing. Eternal Observer? On the topic that I was hiding in a world where nothing changed… … .”
Gaold’s spirit zone unfolded.
“Are you the kind of people who talk about hell?”
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!
As the spirit zones of the two collided, the shockwaves generated spread out in the form of spheres and collapsed the walls of the room in a round shape.
“Big uh… … .”
When the real power was transmitted, Shirone was dying.
What’s comforting, though, is that you’re not the only one struggling.
The unbearable pressure squeezed everyone’s hearts as the world of heat and eternity was jumbled together.
At that time, two golden cogwheels penetrated the curtain of hell and rotated in an interlocking state.
The landscape was sucked in and shattered. As if pulling the center of a carpet, the original world began to emerge from the outside of the landscape.
When hell disappeared, people stared blankly at the cogs.
It turned into Sein’s amber iris and spun rapidly, shining like a halo.
Cheolryunan – Equilibrium.
It was the world’s organ that calms all phenomena with two gears that calculate the coefficient of reason and the coefficient of emotion.
Gaold was satisfied when he confirmed that his alumni’s skills had not rusted before going to heaven.
However, it was unpleasant to be treated the same as Armin as an ally with the same goal.
“what? Even if we beat each other up, it wouldn’t be enough. Are you going to try a three-way battle?”
“It is in front of Master. You may not know at other times, but be careful now.”
Sein’s attitude toward Alpheas was no different from Gaold’s.
When the whole world abandoned the Supernatural Psychic Research Society, he was the only one who took their side.
Gaold also had no choice but to become a Hapjuki this time.
Of course, he wasn’t Alpheas who would be swayed by self-denial, but if there was one person in the world who didn’t want to be a nuisance, he was him.
Sein looked back at Armin.
“I apologize for using your emotions. But we need at least one more talented person. If you knew it from the beginning, why don’t you convince Siena yourself? As I said clearly, we have no intention of forcing the party to give up. It’s not a mission to be performed through coercion.”
Siena stepped forward.
To be honest, I didn’t want to even look at Armin’s face, but I couldn’t see other people squabbling between me.
“Answer me one thing, Armin oppa.”
Armin, who had been unable to even turn his head until now, spoke in a desperate voice when Siena opened the door.
“Siena, sorry for hiding it. But I… … .”
“Is Keira your brother’s wife?”
Keira approached with a bright color as if it was just this time, but quickly withdrew with a pale face.
It was because he felt a terrifying life behind Armin’s back, who turned his head very slightly.
Armin turned to Siena again.
As if it had happened when, the life had disappeared, and it was back to being a mild sheep.
“No, Keira is my watchdog. there was a situation She’s got a sham marriage for a mission. Siena, everything is for you. Give me a chance to explain.”
A cold breath escaped from between Siena’s lips.
fake marriage? guardian?
Are you saying that now?
‘I, how hard I was… … .’
I vowed to forget every night. Trembling with loneliness, desperately suppressing the desire to steal, he wished him a happy life with Keira.
But is it a lie?
After deceiving them to their heart’s content, acting as a loving couple right in front of their eyes, all of that was for my sake?
“Siena, if you want to get angry, I’m fine too. but… … .”
“No, I will tell you.”
Siena held out her hand and stopped talking.
There must have been circumstances. No, even if she hadn’t, she had no right to be angry with Armin.
The kind of life he lived after losing both eyes to save Siena was predictable.
“Your brother is my lifesaver. Even if my brother cheated on me for some reason, it doesn’t change the fact that he gave me a new life.”
Armin closed his mouth and raised his eyebrows.
You don’t have to thank me.
If you want, I can take out my heart right now. Siena, if you wish.
Siena walked over to Armin and hugged him.
Even though she was held in the arms of the man she so desperately wanted, her heart was tingling as if she had been beaten with a whip.
“Thank you, brother. I won’t forget for the rest of my life I will always be grateful for the life my brother gave me. But now we are grown up. You can’t treat each other with only your childhood feelings. stop, leave me That is my last wish for my brother.”
“Siena… … .”
Armin wept in his soul.
Because he had no pupils, he felt miserable as he did not even shed tears.
I have to leave. Siena can do anything she wants.
and will wait Because you might miss yourself because of one small whim.
Even if I don’t, I’ll wait my whole life.
“Okay, I will do as you say. Oppa, he can do anything you want.”
Armin tried to caress Siena’s cheek, but unfortunately turned around with a clenched fist.
“let’s go.”
“Armin, you can’t… … .”
Keira tried to shout something at Siena with a serious expression, but Armin’s flicker magic came first.
The two of them disappeared as the electricity splattered.
The flicker magic that transcends space even in an enclosed place reminded him that he was an unlocker.
Gaold continued with a relieved expression.
“Let’s wrap this up one last time. I can’t be sure if Gangnan will be successful in recruiting, but once he’s brought in, there’s no problem with Util. When Shirone comes in, the range of strategies expands. As for the dealer, Siena and me are enough. Crowd control can be done by Sein, one person in charge of operation, and one person in charge of search.”
Flew felt infinitely proud that his position was mentioned.
Originally, it was a project with no room for a certified 8th grade wizard to intervene. However, in other words, the power leakage of the team was severe.
As expected, Gaold’s expression was impassioned.
I don’t want to make a cage class, but shouldn’t it work if I have an assortment?
“I guess… … I think there should be one hitman. If you can definitely eliminate one target, the range of tactical operations will be greatly expanded. Is there no good knife holder? The one who knows how to cut properly.”
Sein said.
“Where do you get a guy like that all of a sudden? Wasn’t there a magic swordsman in your bodyguard or something?”
“Two pieces of news. probably dead Anyway, think about it once. Even if he dies, he can definitely take out one target. Even if he dies, he doesn’t have to deal with it. In a word, a man who wants to die.”
“You have too many demands.”
“If even one fails, I won’t save you. We are the Suicide Squad. A guy who follows you hoping for a reward is only a minus to the team.”
Ethella said.
“Why don’t you try looking for a certified driver? If you are a renowned swordsman, your skills are certain.”
“no. Those who insist on beliefs burn needlessly. We’re not going to war. Hitman is perfect for focusing on recapturing the maze.”
Sein checked the time and said.
“Let’s go to Galliant for now. There might be someone who uses a knife in the Kergo Autonomous District.”
Then Siena raised her hand.
“Hey, how about a knight without faith?”
Everyone’s eyes turned to Siena.
Gaold raised his eyebrows as if to say something, then asked again.
“A knight without faith? Can you call that a knight? no, it doesn’t matter anyway But why?”
“There is one person. Someone who knows how to bell properly.”

Chapter - 408 - Final Decision (8) 5.txt
===============================
[408] Final Decision (8)
It was a gloomy day.
I rolled up my clothes and packed dry food and first aid kits in case of an emergency.
As I grabbed the full military backpack with my right hand, it went into the Kubrick’s slot.
Shirone, who was examining the scabbard while holding Armand, saved it to Kubrick’s second slot.
Loaded weight 38.7 kg. It could be said that it was captured optimally while leaving an extra space.
“… … .”
Shirone looked around the room to see if anything was missing and checked the time.
After confirming that it was near midnight, I took out Maya’s letter that was stored in the drawer of my desk and read it again.
It was the day of the presentation of the Supernatural Psychic Research Society that Maya fell in love with Shirone.
It felt like destiny when Shirone stood in front of Maya at the senior year welcome party.
The reason why he asked who the girl he wanted to kiss was actually half joking and half serious, but he said it was the result of such a foolish delusion that he would choose him.
Her heart was engraved on four pages of letter paper. It was a confession that she did her best to convey her sincerity rather than embellish and wrap it up.
If you accept my heart, please come out to the park in two days at midnight.
Even if you don’t come out, I will never resent or hate you.
I want you to show your sincerity this time. love you.
Shirone folded the letter along Maya’s crease and put it in the envelope. Then, as if taking something precious, I poked it into his inner pocket and gently pressed it with the palm of my hand.
“Maya… … .”
Shirone left the dorm earlier than the promised time. Should I make her wait until this day?
It was 10 minutes ago when we arrived at the park.
Beneath the only light on, he waited for Maya to come out.
Deng. Deng. Deng.
The midnight bell struck.
As the clouds thickened, the wind and rain came in. Thunder was heard from the distant sky, and cold raindrops fell.
Shoot Aaaaaaa!
Numerous percussion instruments disturbed Shirone’s hearing.
Streams of water trickled down her wet hair, and her clothes were soaking up the water and getting heavier.
Shirone was looking at the path Maya was walking.
Deng.
The bell announcing one o’clock struck.
Until then, Maya hadn’t come.
I heard the sound of water splashing and someone walking behind me.
It was only after the raindrops that fell on her head were blocked that Shirone finally looked back.
Amy was standing with an umbrella.
The two were just looking into each other’s eyes.
Amy wanted Shirone to tell her first, and Shirone had nothing to say to her.
Amy’s emotions, which had been suppressed, finally exploded.
Resentment, anger, bewilderment, betrayal, and perhaps even more desperateness.
She gritted her teeth and spat out in a trembling voice.
“Why did you come out?”
Shirone did not answer.
“say. why did you come here Really Maya and… … .”
“It has nothing to do with you.”
Amy’s heart sank.
I knew that Maya would confess.
The reason why he agreed despite knowing it was the confidence that he had seen Shirone’s feelings with his own eyes. He agreed, and what he regretted was his insecurity about Maya’s courage.
It was Amy who ran around the room nervously and eventually couldn’t stand it and ran to the park.
Shirone was waiting for Maya. And now she was staring at herself with such cold eyes.
“no. It can’t be.”
Amy’s voice crackled.
“What’s going on? I mean, you’re so weird these days. it’s still weird say! Tell me what’s going on! If you don’t tell me, I won’t see you anymore.”
“okay. doesn’t care.”
Amy couldn’t believe it.
Why do you have to treat me so coldly?
It wasn’t the Shirone I used to know. I was afraid.
She was naked in front of Shirone for the first time.
“why? why do you do that why don’t you say anything Is it because I don’t act like Maya? Fool, me too, me too you… … .”
Shirone hugged Amy tightly. Otherwise, there was no way to hide the distorted face.
Hot tears mixed with the cold rain water and ran down my cheeks.
“Amy, thank you so much.”
Embarrassed, Amy burst into tears.
I grabbed Shirone’s collar and tried to shake it off, but it just slipped.
“no. don’t hug I mean say it! tell me why! You bastard!”
There was no strength in his hands.
Time pushed her back and a cliff awaited her in front. For the first time she had the idea that she wanted to turn back time.
Shirone said the last words with a sad smile.
“Hi, Amy… … .”
Took.
The umbrella fell from Amy’s hand. The sound of the stinging rain was huge.
Even when Shirone left her body, she couldn’t move with a dazed expression on her face.
Tears welled up and I couldn’t see anything.
“Ugh. Ugh.”
The moment the sobs that had been blocked in her throat burst out, the sky quiveringly cried on her behalf.
* * *
thump thump! thump thump!
Collie, the head teacher of the senior class, was awakened by the sound of knocking on the door of the annex.
I hurriedly put on my gown, rubbed my sleepy eyes, and opened the door to find Maya soaked in rain.
“Maya? What are you doing at this hour?”
“teacher… … .”
Maya couldn’t control her emotions and burst into tears in Collie’s arms.
“Aaaaaang!”
Collie was perplexed, but looked at Maya’s condition. It seemed that the order would be to calm down the trembling body first.
Colli, who had put wood in the fireplace and made a fire, sat Maya down and handed her a towel.
Cocoa was boiled and placed in front of her, but she just watched the flames in the fireplace, mesmerized.
‘It must have been a crab.’
Collie had a hunch that the day Maya had spoken of was today.
He didn’t show it during the senior year schedule, but he was a disciple whom he loved so much that he personally enrolled him in a magic school and taught him.
‘A young child. I can’t take care of my own feelings because I’m counting other people’s feelings.’
Collie first saw Maya at the opening of an outdoor performance by singer Canary.
Outside the barricade, commoners also had a chance to watch, and the nobles seemed to like this way.
So, the event planner went further and set up a strategy to highlight the excellence of the canary by having a commoner in the opening performance.
That’s how the 14-year-old Maya was recruited.
However, the planner’s tricks went awry. It was because the popular song of a 14-year-old girl was beautiful enough to give goosebumps.
No wonder the nobles were offended, and as soon as the song was over they began to boo and criticize.
It is said that there were even nobles who called the chieftain of the tribe and forced him to bring Maya to bed for a large sum of money.
The chief attacked a nobleman and was beaten to death and kicked out, and Maya gave up her dream of becoming a singer that day.
Collie recommended Maya to become a wizard.
He had a weak temperament, but he certainly had omnipotent talent, and he succeeded in entering the Spirit Zone in two years.
I didn’t want anything like a great wizard.
Wouldn’t that be enough if she could become a wizard, raise the tribe, and sing the song she really wanted to sing?
“Did Shirone-kun not come out?”
Maya gently raised the corner of her mouth. It was the only happiness that could be obtained in pain.
“no. gave it to me Like an idiot, I told you not to come out like that. It wouldn’t matter if you cut off things like me, but I gave it to you. For me, they waited for over an hour.”
Maya covered her face with both hands.
“So it hurts my heart. Because that Shirone is so good. Because I want to be his woman.”
“Shouldn’t you have walked a horse? Could it be that I really liked you?”
Maya shook her head.
“I knew from the beginning that I couldn’t win Shirone’s heart. I confessed even though I knew it. I like it so much, I don’t think I can stand it without talking about it. So she went in knowing it was hell.”
Maya looked back at Collie with a terrified expression.
“But what should I do? It hurts so much. I feel sick and I think I will die. Can we forget Shirone? Can I go back to the way I was before meeting Shirone?”
Cole spoke his mind frankly.
“Maya, you cannot erase past memories. It is something you will have to live with for the rest of your life.”
“I don’t think I can. Being so sick… … how… … .”
Maya finally sobbed.
Collie came over and hugged her and gave her a pat on the back.
“There is no need to be afraid. Scars don’t go away, but as you live, so many new scars form that you don’t know which ones Shirone left behind. Then you’ll be fine again. Just live like that.”
Maya rubbed her face against Collie’s chest.
“It is not living. With no hope… … How can I live?”
“Maya, I don’t live for hope. It is to create hope in order to live. I won’t be able to forget it, but everything will be alright. You can create another hope.”
“I hate that. I want Shirone to come to me. She wants you to love me with poetry.”
When cut by a knife, it doesn’t hurt. What really hurts was when I realized I had been cut.
That is why the emotion Maya felt now was fear, not pain. Fear of the pain to come.
‘The more tender the heart, the harder it will be. But Maya, an artist is someone who talks about humans. Even when he looks down from a high place, he never sees humans. So remember today’s pain. Sing in the lowest place. Then one day everyone will heal your wounds.’
Collie stroked Maya’s back.
Her shoulders trembled pitifully, like a baby bird whose wings have been snapped by a storm.
* * *
3 am.
Since there was no intention of sleeping in the first place, Shirone returned to the inn and washed herself and changed into new clothes.
As I sat down at my desk and blocked my thoughts for a while, the lingering lingering sound of crying leaked out by itself.
“Has everything been sorted out now?”
Withdrew from the Supernatural Psychic Research Society. Nade was very angry, but eventually hugged him and told him to come back no matter what.
And today, I ended my own goodbyes to Maya and Amy.
I wanted to sever all ties before going to heaven.
No, I had to.
If you have any regrets here, you will hesitate at the decisive moment. Because you will hesitate in a situation where you must die.
In a short period of time, Shirone had sorted out all the ties that could be sorted out.
But still, the faces of precious people came to my mind.
Ryan, Tess, and… … Parents who always want only their son’s happiness.
I was fortunate enough to say I love you before leaving home.
It was, truly, the best thing in Shirone’s life.
I opened the drawer and took out a clean stationery. The greetings that could not be said now had no choice but to be conveyed in writing.
Spinning the nib with her finger, Shirone finally wrote a letter on the paper.
history
“Black. Sobbing.”
Tears flowed from sadness.
I wanted to graduate from magic school. I wanted to experience the world with my friends. She wanted to feel again the thrill she felt when she held Amy’s hand.
“mom… … ”
Shirone’s only parents are Vincent and Olina. That fact will never change.
I should have known before going to heaven.
No, I didn’t meet Ikael from the beginning.
But I found out.
She didn’t express it to anyone, but in fact, she had the answer to the question that had been in her heart for the rest of her life.
‘I’m sorry, I’m sorry.’
Shirone wiped away tears with her sleeve and wrote a will.
Thanks to the people who have helped me, stories about how happy I was because I received a lot of love, and even respect for my parents.
Everything that had been stored for 19 years was being emptied.

Chapter - 409 - Task Force (1) 4.txt
===============================
[409] Task Force (1)
Magic Association.
Sakiri, an investigator belonging to the Inspection Division 3 who had previously interrogated Canis and Arin, was on his way to the prison camp for special criminals under the Association.
Next to him was Blenner, the third deputy director of the National Intelligence Service.
The National Intelligence Service’s 3rd Division is the Daecheonguk Information Management Department, a secret organization composed only of black agents whose ranks are not disclosed to civilians.
The reason why the head of such a department personally visited the association was to obtain an item to stop Gaold’s plan.
It was the confession of Isabelle, the 3rd class archmage.
“Anyway, it’s a problem, a problem. Speaking of Gaold. It’s the shame of the kingdom. I didn’t like it from the start. After making a lot of people tired, you can just walk away by yourself.”
Sakiri was not fooled by Blenner’s good impression.
Everyone in the Inspection Department knew that the lobby of Rufist, who is currently serving as the temporary head of the Magic Association, entered Blenner.
“Isabel, that woman is really strong too. Her face is pretty, tsk tsk. Wizards can’t do this.”
It is not a good thing to hear a wizard’s gossip from a non-magician.
Especially if the target of the gossip is a certified third-class archmage he usually respects.
However, Sakiri did not show emotion. He shuts off his emotions with such ease, sometimes when necessary.
“I hear you are the best on this floor. cook to your heart’s content I’ll do the rear end. I must make her mouth open.”
“It is not easy. Even if he is a non-combatant, he is definitely a great wizard. I’m definitely not the kind of person who would commit perjury out of fear of pain.”
“Hehe, isn’t that why I called you? Sakiri of the 3rd Inspection Division, who says that any criminal can’t even be beaten as long as he gets caught.”
“I will try my best.”
Sakiri replied in a dry voice, deep in thought.
Temporary president Rufist has long regarded Gaold as a thorn in the eye. In my mind, I would want to eliminate Gaold even with all the power of the Association.
‘But things didn’t go as planned.’
He seized the opportunity to fulfill his long-cherished wish, but the problem was that Gaold’s reputation within the association was not as bad as expected.
He’s a madman, but that’s why he’s pure, and even though he has a nasty temper, he’s stronger than anyone else.
And this was clearly outside of Lufist’s calculations.
The incident in which Isabelle risked her life to protect Gaold during the National Emergency Hearing left a great deal of embarrassment to the Wizards of the Association.
Someone outside of Gaold’s bodyguard insisted on Gaold’s innocence.
If that is also the guarantee of Isabelle of the official third class, the standard of judgment will be shaken regardless of whether it is true or not.
With the high ground in front of his eyes, Rufist became desperate.
He needed a reason to mobilize all of the association’s strength, as he could only become the official head of the association by eliminating Gaold, so it was Blenner, the 3rd deputy director of the National Intelligence Service, who reached out.
‘This is my conclusion. but… … .’
The question still lingered.
Forcing perjury and torturing certified magicians is dangerous even for the NIS. But how did it get approved?
‘Who’s behind it?’
Sakiri hinted at Blenner’s intentions.
“How far can I get a confession? Isabelle said in fact she was an Old Guard and she was so she was sheltered, is this enough?”
“Hmm, shouldn’t it be a little taller than that? It was enough to lead the plot to assassinate Her Highness. Whether you designed it or distributed the money, you do it yourself.”
‘I’m thinking of letting go completely.’
No one should know what will happen underground today. Thinking of pruning everything that can be pruned.
This was the reason Sakiri was in charge of the interrogation alone, without even an observer.
“As long as I don’t die, I can do anything, so just accept a confession. I’ve installed a video recording device. Then get out Obscura B and bring it to me. And you are special.”
‘It was something like that.’
The final puzzle was put together in Sakiri’s head.
The beauty archmage’s torture process is recorded in its entirety. Could there be a better snuff for old politicians joining a decadent society?
That’s just why.
Outside, a king’s assassination attempt is taking place, the head of the Magic Association is changing, and the world is about to turn upside down, but someone is just immersed in their hobby.
‘Perhaps this is also a very humane thing.’
Sakiri understood.
If you have the ability to do something, humans do it.
Upon arriving at the prison cell for special offenders, Sakiri fixed her eyes on the iron door.
Whether he had heard anything, Blenner did not show interest in the circumstances behind the iron gate.
“Then please. deal with it as soon as possible You have to get a confession within 48 hours.”
48 hours.
“Do not worry. This is the guy who came all the way here.”
Blenner patted Sakiri on the shoulder with confidence and turned around.
It wasn’t until the sound of footsteps echoing in the hallway died down that Sakiri reached for the iron door’s security device.
Upon entering the Spirit Zone, the lock on the iron door reading the personal information rattled and unlocked.
I pulled the half-open iron door and found Isabelle sitting on a tandem chair installed against the wall of the dark prison.
A model employee of the Magic Association who always adhered to neat attire and took pride in it.
But now, with disheveled hair covering his face and his wrists resting on his knees, he was a shabby criminal with mana control devices handcuffed.
Two on the left and right sides, and one on the side of the iron gate. A total of three video recording devices were installed.
The one in the front flashed a red light and was recording Isabelle’s condition for several days.
“It feels strange to meet you in a place like this.”
Isabelle didn’t respond.
He was just repeating empty breaths in a limp posture like a corpse.
Sakiri didn’t care and checked the video recording devices while unbuttoning his sleeve.
“Do you know what is the scariest thing I’ve ever felt in my life? It means that humans are endowed with unlimited freedom. It really is. No matter how absurd, humans can do it.”
After confirming that the video recording device on the left was turned off, Sakiri moved to the wall on the right.
“Is it impossible to strangle a child who does not get sick even if he puts it in his eyes? Isn’t it too stupid to believe if you think so? No matter how much you love it, just do it. That is human freedom.”
After checking the second device, Sakiri looked into the lens of the last device turned on and said.
“Reset Obscura B to save records.”
When I pressed the button, the device turned off, ready to restart.
It was only after the three video recording devices turned off that Isabelle raised her head. The eyes that gave up her hope confirmed Sakiri’s face.
“Come to think of it, it’s tomorrow, the first son’s death.”
Sakiri is now the father of two daughters, but originally had one more son. However, the son suffered from Tris disease, which rots the whole body, two years after he was born, and died two years later.
Sakiri was a regular eater.
“Well, this is life. Then shall we begin?”
When the switch installed on the wall was lowered, the incandescent light in the ceiling turned on, making the prison as bright as daylight.
thud! thud! thud! thud!
Then, the walls opened in series, and the prison expanded as long as the corridor.
Every conceivable instrument of torture and equipment was placed there.
“Usually torture chambers are dark, but I like the light side. Torture is also a kind of communion. It might make you feel a little dirty to see your body breaking down, but just give up.”
Sakiri took the scissors to cut the prison uniform and checked the blade.
“What should I do first? What are you weak against? ache? foreign body sensation? fear? body transformation? Shame?”
Isabelle said in a calm voice.
“You’re kind, Sakiri.”
“I understand with duality. There’s nothing good about stimulating them before they even start. We’d better start with the water torture. For the sake of the show, it is better to have a clean body first.”
“If not… … Why are you conflicting?”
Sakari’s fingers stopped snapping the scissors.
“conflict?”
“You would have known. No matter what you do to me, I will not withdraw from speaking at the hearing. However, your rule of thumb, ‘The Balance of Truth’ is an exception. I don’t know the activation conditions, but there’s no need to waste time playing house like this, right?”
Sakiri, who had been silently looking at the scissors, sighed and turned around.
“Haa, as long as this guy or that guy is alive.”
Limp!
The scissors nervously fell back to where they were.
Sakiri, who had been standing still, turned slowly and looked down at Isabelle.
“… … Why did you do that?”
Isabelle tilted her head slightly, as if not understanding the meaning.
“Why are you coming? You’re not even a member of the Royal Guard. It’s the same as using Gaold, Lufist, or the Association for personal purposes. Lufist took over the association to gain power, and Gaold became the president of the association for revenge. Why did you protect Gaold anyway?”
Isabelle’s answer was simple.
“I don’t know either.”
“I do not know?”
“Sakiri, I don’t know. It’s not a thoughtful decision. Yes, like you said, both Gaold and Luffist are self-centered people. Still, the reason why I chose Gaold… … .”
Isabelle thought for a moment and smiled bitterly.
“I just liked Gaold a little better than Lufist. That’s all.”
“… … .”
Sakiri flicked her jaw joint left and right.
Then he turned back to the shelf where the instruments of torture were placed, his face contorted like that of a sick person.
‘Damn it. There was such an easy way.’
Since when did the name wizard come to be called a politician’s dog?
Aren’t those who fought with an iron intellect who pushed through what they believed to be right now in the association?
“… … 48 hours.”
Sakiri picked up an instrument of torture that looked like a 20 cm long awl.
“In the next 48 hours, Rufist will defy public opinion and move the Association. Of course, if you perjury in it, the time will be shorter.”
Isabelle hadn’t even thought of that situation.
“Forty-eight hours. It’s pretty tight.”
“That’s why Lufist is also impatient. If possible, he would like to become the president of the association with the support of the majority of the association members, but as long as Gaold is alive, his current position is in jeopardy. In short, as long as you hold out, you can buy yourself more time.”
Sakiri poked the awl with the tip of her finger, then looked back at Isabelle with a cold gaze.
“I will protect the last degree of dignity as a human being and as a woman. It’s not because I have good feelings for you. As a mage, I just don’t want to cater to the tastes of perverted old men. But the pain will be considerable.”
Isabelle didn’t care. She just stared up at her ceiling, lost in her thoughts, oblivious to the terrible time ahead.
‘Whoops, Gaold. Seriously, how many people are you bothering?’
yeah, why?
Why did he defend Gaold, who had nothing to do with him?
‘Perhaps I, too, have been possessed by your madness.’
The light came on as the video recording device restarted.
After activating the remaining two devices, Sakiri stood where the three focus points were set and announced the start of the official interrogation.
“From now on, I will begin interrogating Isabelle, the manager of the magic library of the Magic Association.”
Isabelle’s eyes lit up for the first time.
‘Go, Gaold. Go beyond good and evil, transcend the future of mankind, and go to the ultimate realm that humans can reach.’
Sakiri grabbed Isabelle’s hair and violently raised it.
His eyes widened as he stared at the soft nape of his neck.
’48 hours from now. Hold on.’
Screams echoed through the corridor of the prison cell.

===============================
[410] Task Force (2)
If you go about 2 hours by carriage from the city of Creas, you will come to the small port town of San Ferros.
Galliant is a world-class resort, but the scenery here outside the holiday season was just a secluded fishing village.
Arriving around lunchtime, Shirone bought a handful of fish fillets from the stall.
The fish pho, which is said to be delicious only when slightly spoiled, was chewy like jelly and had the deep taste of the sea.
There was no liner, so I thought I would have to hire a captain.
The fare is expensive, but the money saved so far will not be enough.
When I asked the villagers, they said that it takes about an hour for the boats that left early in the morning to come back with the meat.
Since there was nowhere to go, Shirone walked to the breakwater and looked at the distant sea.
It’s not the first time I’ve been on a trip, and my teammates are waiting for me on the island, but I felt like I was left alone in the world.
‘School must be lunchtime now.’
Shirone didn’t think about it.
There is nowhere to go back to. shouldn’t have been
“Are you Aryan Shirone?”
A woman in a costume completely different from that of the Tormia Kingdom was standing behind Shirone.
Even in the warm weather, the sleeves came down to the wrists, and the hood hanging down the back was thicker than winter clothes.
The look of her biting on a black nipple was very different, but the woman’s eyes were deep and mysterious, so it was an atmosphere that made it impossible to look at her with strange eyes.
Shirone turned her attention to the strange creature floating above the woman’s head.
It was a soft and transparent monster, and the sphere inside it was generating an electric field as it rotated.
An auto prism that scatters light to create a transparent effect in a specific range.
It had almost no fighting power, but it was a monster listed in the 4th tier of summoning magic with great utility.
Shirone gave a wary look.
In the worst situation, he would pick up Armand and fight, but if he was a wizard who summoned a Tier 4 monster, he would have to be seen as inferior in terms of ability.
“Who are you? how can i get my name… … .”
“My name is Zulu. Gaold told me to bring you.”
“huh? Everything?”
For a moment, being embarrassed by the bizarre use of language, Shirone opened her eyes wide and looked directly at the woman’s face.
“yes? Zulu?”
There was no way he didn’t know the name of the world’s only and strongest summoning wizard who could match a tier 1 lich.
In disbelief, Shirone pointed her finger at her and checked again.
“… … Zulu?”
“Yes, Zulu.”
Zulu nodded nonchalantly and said.
“I don’t have much time. I need to cross the border before dark, so follow me.”
“Where is the president of the association?”
“They have already arrived at Galliant and are preparing for the Gangran. Are you going or not?”
“I’ll go.”
When I gave up my exhausting search and approached Zulu, she disarmed the auto prism and cast a mass teleport.
The landscape seemed to be pulled into a single point, and then expanded into a new landscape.
It was halfway up the mountain behind the port.
The breakwater where the two of them were was small at the far end of the field of vision, and at the bottom of the mountain was a village of fishing villagers.
Zulu summoned the grotesque Kaidra from there.
Its smooth, hairless skin had a long snout like an awl, and its huge claws that supported its body seemed to be holding a mountain.
Contrary to his hideous appearance, Kaidra rubbed his beak on Zulu like a child, then knelt down and let one wing hang down.
Shirone climbed on the wings following Zulu.
Caydra’s backbone protrudes out of the skin like a shark’s fin, so it blocks air resistance and allows it to sit in the hollow of the backbone, giving it a good sense of stability.
“be careful. I will fly high.”
Caydra, flapping her wings and pushing off the ground with her two legs, flew straight up as soon as she surfaced.
Shirone, tired of her pale face, stared at the fast-approaching sky.
When I started flying in normal orbit, the ground was only a distant dot.
“A lift-based rogue named Kaidra. They don’t need as much oxygen, so they can fly at higher altitudes than strength-based creatures. In this way, the probability of avoiding the search system Joner’s algorithm increases.”
Searching the sky is not too difficult for zoners who have a spirit zone with a basic diameter of 2 kilometers.
However, as the altitude increased, the shape of the spirit zone had to be transformed into a target type or sniper mode, so it was natural that the search range would decrease.
Shirone finally felt a sense of reality.
The person in front of me was really a Zulu.
“Thank you for coming to pick me up. To be honest, I never thought that such a great person would come to greet me.”
“Gaold said the Association would move sooner or later. It looks like there is stillness inside. I fixed it as soon as possible and took the lead to heaven. So I was in charge of the transport. Right now, I am on my way to pick up a woman named Siena.”
“Oh, I see.”
“Of course, I would have come even if the matter was not urgent. Sein said he would use anything that could be used to produce results. I’ll be in charge of utilities on the team, so you can tell me anything you need for the mission.”
Zulu’s words made sense.
From now on, we need to move organically as a team. Regardless of seniors and juniors, they must do their best in their respective duties.
“yes! I wish you well!”
Shirone bowed her head courageously.
* * *
Kentra city.
The meat produced in Kentra, Tormia’s famous pastoral area, is designated as a royal tribute because of its high quality.
The catering business was also active, and an entire street was filled with restaurants.
People wearing cowboy hats often passed by, leather clothes were popular, and whips sold like hot cakes.
However, the reason why Siena decided to meet here wasn’t because the meat was delicious or to buy Kentra specialties.
It was because this was exactly the halfway point when they started from Kreas and Baska.
Siena checked the restaurant sign and opened the door.
Compared to Creas, the atmosphere was more conventional, and although reservations were made, the seats were sparsely empty.
After emptying the glass of water the waiter poured out, she anxiously waited for the person she would meet today.
There were about 20 minutes left until the appointment time, but it was still unsure if he would come out.
No, if you’re sane, there’s no way you’ll come out.
After seeing the match, I didn’t contact you once, but I only got a certified 5th grade congratulatory letter, so I made a lunch appointment.
That too by rapid telegram.
There was no one who received a telegram at dawn, prepared it in a hurry, and went all the way to Kentra City to eat meat.
‘Because it’s worth the bottom line.’
The door opened with a bell and a man entered.
Parka Kuan, an instructor at the Kaizen Swordsmanship Academy.
The cold eyes watching the atmosphere in the hall were still the same, but the outfit was different from the last time they met, and they seemed to be quite careful.
Kuan’s icy stare only softened a little when he saw Siena sitting at the table.
As he moved his body with a limp, all eyes of the nobles focused on him.
I never tried to hide the fact that my legs were uncomfortable, but I always felt like a loser in the crowd.
Especially when people’s eyes shifted from Kuan to Siena, I felt the urge to cut down everyone in this place.
Siena stood up and raised her hand.
As per his personality, he couldn’t even give a friendly smile, but he had an attitude that didn’t care about people’s gazes.
There is also Armin who sacrificed both eyes for her.
The fact that Kuan’s legs were uncomfortable didn’t bother Siena at all.
Being conscious of prejudice is not something that can be hidden, so Kuando could feel Siena’s sincerity.
Maybe that’s why I didn’t even know the topic and didn’t know if I had come this far.
“You came. Sorry for the rude request.”
“As this is an urgent telegram, I thought there must be a reason. For now, please sit down.”
The food was served, but the two were still silent. I was just concentrating on cutting the meat and putting it in my mouth.
Whoever it was, there was no immunity in this position.
Still, Kuan, a man, mustered up the courage to speak to me for the first time.
“Congratulations. Certified 5th class wizard. You are really cool at such a young age.”
Siena couldn’t put it off any longer.
She didn’t have much time, and if Kuan refused, she had to leave immediately for Galliant.
“I sent you a telegram because I have a request for you.”
It was a strange word to say in return for congratulations, so Kuan blinked while holding the tableware.
Then he nodded his head and said.
“Yes, you say.”
Siena explained the project.
Information that could put the team at risk was blocked, but the world’s notice would end tomorrow, so the content was core and nothing harsh.
“… … So, I wanted to have at least one hitman in the team. I think Mr. Kuan is the right person.”
Kuan, who remained motionless until the end of the story, dropped the tableware onto the plate with a rattling sound. And she gulped down the water as if she had lost her appetite.
Siena calmly waited.
It’s no different from saying that I’m going to die. It will leave a stigma in history.
Persuasion is impossible anyway.
From now on, it was entirely up to him to decide.
Kuan turned his gaze to the dining room floor, lost in thought. Then he looked back at Siena and said.
“Can I ask you one question?”
“Anything. Any information that can be revealed.”
“Why me?”
Siena’s eyes fell coldly.
“As you can see, my leg is not intact. And for me, the legs are an important test. Why does it have to be me?”
“That’s Kuan-san’s skills… … .”
Siena swallowed the compliment in her throat.
There was no way he didn’t know how Kuan had come to this place. No man would drive all the way to lunch with a woman he didn’t even like.
Armin had sent him off with his heart, but he thought that he shouldn’t use Kuan’s heart.
I just wanted to reveal the truth and wait for his decision.
“Kuan-san, it doesn’t matter when you die.”
Siena said with a determined expression.
“I heard that there are no parents, no siblings, no connections. Even if Mr. Kuan dies, there is no force that can move. I thought there was no need to take care of it even if things went wrong.”
Kuan looked at Siena with blank eyes.
No matter how much you say this to someone’s face.
Somehow, from the moment I received the urgent telegram, I thought things were going well.
“But never underestimate your skills. Kuan-san’s swordsmanship… … .”
“Kuk-kuk. Whoop whoop whoop!”
Kuan lowered his head and laughed with his shoulders trembling, and Siena stopped talking with a nervous expression.
“Even when I die, I don’t have to take care of it? If you really thought so… … .”
Kuan opened his eyes and bit his lips.
“You’ve come to the right place.”
Now I know, why was this woman.
There is no pity as much as there is no prejudice.
To him, who was tired of the pretentious life of a human being, he showed self-deprecation.
Kuan withdrew his earlier thoughts.
Still, it seems that God is still looking into her life.
it’s heaven
Could there be a more suitable place for a sword demon’s tomb?
Kuan got up from his seat on the table.
“Let’s go. It seems urgent. There is nothing to do other than prepare. The personal affairs were already done 10 years ago.”
“I’d appreciate it if you would, but at least a message… … .”
“Do not worry. It’s a decision I made as a single prosecutor. It will be too late if you prepare yourself at the moment of death. There is no need to look back on the way to the battlefield.”
It was a bit of an extreme resolution, but it was hard to find a more suitable person for the role of a hitman.
Regardless of their motive, a suicide commando who takes on the future of mankind and plunges into the fire.
Siena sincerely respected his resolve.
“thank you.”
Kuan, as a swordsman, also lowered his head as if swearing by a sword.
“I am.”

Chapter - 411 - Task Force (3).txt
===============================
[411] Task Force (3)
Kaidra, a mysterious bird flying toward Galliant Island, spotted a cargo ship crossing the open sea and lowered its altitude.
As Zulu freed Kydra, the four, including Siena and Kuan, began plummeting toward the sea at high speed.
Zulu and Siena use fly magic, and Shirone spreads her wings to control the speed of her fall.
Godot may not be a familiar environment for the prosecutor Kuan, but he was checking the position of the ship without blinking.
The ability to offset gravitational acceleration by generating external gravitational force with muscle vibration was not inferior to the wizard’s skills in the slightest.
Siena admired the skill of the death magician, whom she had only heard about through rumors.
A person who was evaluated as an unrivaled talent in swordsmanship movement 10 years ago.
Such a man lost his Achilles heel. As if he had lost an eye for himself.
‘Come to think of it, they look alike.’
The four of them hurled themselves toward the vessel and landed on the uninhabited aft deck.
At the same time, Zulu summoned Autoprism, making everyone invisible.
‘As expected, it’s easy to solve because talented people gather.’
How many people can infiltrate a boat floating in the sea and go to Galliant without being noticed by anyone?
If Sein had been there, he would have been able to block out the sound with Equilibrium.
No matter how dangerous heaven is, I thought that a team like this would not be easily defeated.
The warehouse was loaded with land products.
The four of them went to the piled up bags of rice in the corner and sat down with their backs facing each other.
“Once we arrive at the port, Autoprism cannot be summoned. Because there is a risk of getting caught by Jonah. Flu will be waiting for you at the mid-junction, so you have to get out as undetected as possible.”
Siena handed the robe to Kuan.
Zulu can cover his face enough with the clothes he is wearing now, and Shirone can solve it neatly by using the Diamond Armament.
An hour later, the ship docked in the harbor. There was a commotion outside the warehouse, and the door opened hastily.
The four men, who had been hiding against the wall, slipped through the door as soon as the sailors entered.
On the deck, workers from the island were busy loading cargo, so no one cared about the four of them.
When we went down to the dock, it was crowded with ship mechanics, freight forwarders, warehouse managers, and traders.
Jis, who had a deep relationship with Shirone, was also busily running between the docks, soliciting tourists.
“now! We’ll lift your load! We will also guide you to the Kergo ruins, a specialty of Galliante! Interpreters are available!”
Shirone put on the robe of the Diamond Armed Forces and gently turned her head to look at Jis.
‘It’s the same, Jess. Is Yuna doing well?’
There was no way the place would be empty just because the parrot thieves had left, but it seemed like they were living a healthy life in their own way.
“huh? Who is it?”
When Jess turned around, Shirone gently lowered her head and followed the group out of the dock.
I wanted to say hello, but there was nothing to say as I was leaving the world and heading for the limb.
‘Be happy, Jess.’
Jis, who was staring blankly at Shirone, approached Jis with tears in her eyes.
“Ugh, why are there so few customers today? huh? Jess, what’s wrong? As if I saw a ghost. Who’s here?”
“No, I feel strange for some reason. I mean those people.”
The friend looked at the figures in Hood and frowned. It seemed that Jess’ bad habit had come out again.
“Hey, don’t worry about people like that. It’s bloody just looking at it. If I get caught wrongly, I can’t even pick a bone.”
Another friend agreed.
“As a solicitor for 10 years, my intuition is the same. Those people, it smells of great danger.”
Jess couldn’t look away from his friends until they disappeared.
I don’t know why, but the feeling of nostalgia permeated me.
‘Come to think of it… … Are you living well?’
“hey! Jim here! Do you have a handyman?”
A tall man got off the ferry and waddled around with a luggage bag in each hand.
Jess hurriedly came to his senses. And he raised his hand and ran faster than anyone else.
“yes yes! going!”
* * *
Kergo Ruins.
Gaold, Gangnan, Sein, Zulu, Flu, Ethella, Siena, Kuan, Shirone.
The nine people who participated in this project gathered together for the first time.
There was no need for a separate briefing because the horses came and went.
There were several agents within the ruins, but they were all resolved on the line of the people who had been waiting for a day.
Of course, being careless is prohibited, so it’s good to cover your face.
However, the key target, Gaold, flipped the hood and took off his robe and threw it to the ground.
Gangnan bit his molar and said.
“Wear it when you say nice things.”
“stuffy. Anyway, if you go in now, it’s over. From now on we go to Kergo Autonomous Region.”
Sein added.
“If there’s someone waiting at the Guffin’s door, I’ll pick them based on their skills. Perhaps one of these members could be supplemented.”
The group made their way to the terraced altar on the east side of the central temple.
This is where Shirone opened the Immortal Function and passed the labyrinth test.
A native of Kergo was guarding the entrance, but it was different from the person Shirone had seen before.
Since Chief Khadum had lost his lifespan, he didn’t know it, but the situation of the Kergo tribe must have changed considerably.
When I visited with my friends a year ago, he was a native who boasted of a terrifying prayer, but when he saw Gaold and his friends, he gulped down his saliva rather nervously.
If the gatekeeper was also a Kergo warrior, there was no way he wouldn’t be able to feel the refined aura like the blades spun by 9 people at the same time.
Gaold strode over and spoke.
“Keltia, Lo Hoima. Akrasia, Widmia Benzene.”
knock on my door Then it will open.
It was a code of memories that remained even in Shirone’s memory.
However, the reaction of the natives was different than before. He shook his head with a serious face and spoke in Kergo.
“Not now. There are too many people waiting to go to heaven. Come back in three days.”
When Gaold gently crinkled his forehead and swung the back of his hand, the native flew away with a popping sound.
Shirone, who was staring at the aboriginal who fell to the ground and didn’t even move, asked Sein.
“Are you mad at what the natives said?”
“Gaold doesn’t know Kergore.”
“… … .”
When Gaold activated the device, the walls of the altar caved in, creating a door.
Gangnan added a word.
“But I hate Kergo.”
Upon entering the altar, the square spiral staircase descended endlessly.
After going down for about 20 minutes, the corridor continued. As before, there were two natives guarding the iron gate.
From this point on, it is a Kergoman world with no intersections with outside civilizations.
The natives had no qualms about revealing tattoos on their bodies, and were far more aggressive than those guarding them above.
“for a moment. how did you get in Starting today, the entrance to heaven… … .”
Gaold struck the chin with the back of his hand, and the native fell with a thump.
The colleague tried to shout with angry eyes, but then the back of the other hand turned his chin.
Shirone stared blankly at the two natives, who passed out with a bloody nose, and thought that this shouldn’t be the case.
If you open the Immortal Function in the Achievement and Sacrifice Room, you will be welcomed by everyone and go to the Guffin’s Door. There was no need to stir up trouble with Kergo.
“Hey, can’t we just do what’s right? I know a little bit about the natives here, but if you reveal all eight eyes of an angel… … .”
“angel?”
Gaold stood tall and turned his head.
“Shirone, this is just a toy made by my classmate.”
Shirone shut his mouth.
I felt a terrible anger in Gaold, but it wasn’t just because of it. I could see why he hated Kergo.
An octagonal room appeared inside the iron door.
There were three men guarding the iron gate on the other side, and in the middle stood a man with a white tattoo, symbolizing Kergo priest.
Even in Shirone’s eyes, the level of force was different from those who had stood in his way.
However, Gaold didn’t even look at him and went into the altar where the eight orbs of the maze were floating.
Priest Kergo moved his steps with a grim expression on his face.
“Who are you? A stranger who dares to enter the holy angel’s room… … .”
Before he could finish his words, Gaold grabbed whatever orb he could find and cast a spell.
As soon as the simple air press, which had nothing to do with magic, went in, the altar rang with a thud.
The priest looked around the shaking room with a surprised expression, then hurriedly turned his gaze to the orb.
The white light that Shirone couldn’t see even with all his means a year ago was brightly lit.
Shirone stared intently at the orb.
It was strange that the white light really came on, but above all, it was the first time that the size of the numbers came out so small.
1,008,000.
“1 million 8,000 points… … .”
Gaold approached the distraught priest, stared him straight in the eyes, and gave a brief reply.
“Move.”
I don’t know what it means, but the priest’s legs moved before I knew it and opened the way for Gaold.
It was a number that far exceeded the score that could be passed in the language of God.
Upon arriving at the Kergo Autonomous District, warriors who had already heard the news were guarding the entrance.
As they raised their arms, their eyes flashed with vigilance against strangers.
“This is the sacred land of Kergo! If you invade, I will kill you regardless of the reason!”
Gaold compressed a ball of air over his palm as he walked over to the barrier of spears that stretched like a porcupine.
Compared to the subjects of Heaven, the Kergos here are cute.
Warriors who sacrifice their lives for Ankera. In addition, the level of personal power was different from those of them.
But to Gaold, they were all Kergos.
“Everyone take down your weapons!”
Just as Gaold’s press magic was about to explode, a stalwart man walked through the warriors.
The black tattoo turned golden, but Shirone could recognize his face at a glance.
As a member of the anti-angel faction, he was Mahatu, who was at odds with Chief Kadum.
Having a golden tattoo means that you have become a chieftain.
As expected, the warriors drew their weapons and bent their knees.
“Chief! They are heretics who assaulted Kergo! Why are you quenching our fighting spirit!”
Mahatu, who made eye contact with Gaold for a moment, moved to the group of eight people standing behind him.
“It’s been a while, Mr. Shirone.”
Mahatu learned the continental language.
It was the principle that religion and society should be separated to improve the lives of the tribal people, so it was a must-have in order to negotiate with the Galliant government.
“Mr. Mahatu, you have become the chief.”
“I don’t know if I deserved it, but it happened.”
The warriors couldn’t hold back their anger.
To them, assaulting priests was the worst felony that could not be replaced with anything.
“Chief! Please explain! Who are they!”
Mahatu asked Shirone with a puzzled expression.
“Why didn’t you prove the power of an angel?”
“Ah, that… … There were some circumstances.”
Mahatu seemed to know.
Recently, many people have been flocking to Kergo Ruins.
What the hell is going on in heaven?
The seriousness of the situation could be seen just by looking at the level of those brought by Shirone.
‘What the hell are those monsters?’
Kergo’s greatest warrior, Mahatu, could feel it.
Each one of them was a master who honed his different strains to the limit. Gaold, in particular, was not human.
Even Shirone couldn’t help it if she, who thought she would never lose to anyone in terms of fighting spirit, would lose her mind just by looking into her eyes for a moment.
Since the compromise was in progress, there was no extreme conflict, but the war of nerves between the warriors and Gaold was still fierce.
“Punish the heretic who assaulted the priest! We are ready to fight! I’m not afraid of anything like you!”
“Yes, come in! Come in and see!”
Gangnan pathetically looked at Gaold, who was arguing with warriors who could not speak the language, and rubbed his temples.
‘As expected, I didn’t make that human the commander.’
Even so, the reason for leaving it alone is that sometimes Gaold’s method is necessary.
Above all, isn’t it the beginning of the day he’s been waiting for 20 years?
It was a tough day that even the most ugly duckling couldn’t nag at today.
“Quiet everyone! How dare you disobey my order!”
“Chief! We are ready to die at the chief’s command. But compromising with heresy is not even denying the existence of Kergo!”
“Stupid. Do you know who is here right now?”
The warriors’ eyes turned to Shirone.
However, even a year ago, they were imprisoned under the iron fist of Kadum, and they did not know the boy’s face.
Mahatu raised his hand and introduced Shirone.
“This is God’s messenger, Shirone-sama, who punished the Kadum faction and saved us half-angel faction.”

Chapter - 412 - Task Force (4) 1.txt
===============================
[412] Task Force (4)
Shirone and the others followed Mahatu through a complicated maze.
Upon learning that they were messengers of God, the warriors knelt in unison, and even after entering together, they were welcomed by the tribesmen.
Unlike Kadum, who paid a huge tribute to the messenger of God in order to obtain eternal life, Mahatu managed Kergo’s funds transparently.
The lives of the tribesmen improved, and the faces of those passing by were full of energy.
Although she didn’t fight for Kergo, Shirone, who opened the Guffin’s door and went to heaven, was their savior.
“I’d like to have a festival at least, but it seems that the situation is urgent.”
“yes. I have to go to heaven as soon as possible.”
Mahatu did not inquire about the circumstances of heaven.
Kergoin still worships Anchera and reveres angels, but the most important thing to him is the life of the tribesmen.
Sein asked.
“How many people are on the waiting list? I heard earlier that it is saturated.”
Anyone can go to heaven if the Unlocker opens the Guffin’s door, but in order to prevent indiscriminate passage to heaven, Maze created a room of achievement and sacrifice and arranged that only the chosen warriors pass through.
If it was saturated, it meant that there were quite a few people waiting for the Unlocker to come.
Mahatu tastefully smacked his lips.
“Actually, not that many. About 7 people.”
“Strange. But why did you block the entry?”
“That is… … Actually, it’s not something I can talk about. But you will know when you see it for yourself.”
Gaold didn’t care.
Anyway, the only thing to do in Kergo was Guffin’s Gate.
If there were talented people waiting for heaven, he would take them, but it would be difficult to match them as the level of the team members was high.
“it’s okay. Let’s go and see it, and let’s get rid of it quickly.”
As if expressing sincerity, Mahatu accelerated his steps.
The place they arrived at was a huge iron gate with a giant sculpture engraved on it.
“This is the warrior’s room. Warriors who want to go to heaven are waiting here.”
When Mahatu opened the iron door, Gaold quickly entered and the party followed.
The seven warriors Mahatu said were sitting in different places, keeping a keen eye on Gaold.
The swordsman, who was sitting with a longsword in his arms, asked.
“A warrior or an angel?”
Gaold didn’t respond, checked the faces of the seven people, then turned to Sein and said.
“You have to be at least level 6 certified. Other than that, it’s not worth evaluating.”
The wizard in the corner frowned.
“You talk as if you’re going to be a certified 6th grader.”
“What if?”
“haha! Is that why you’re so arrogant? Certified wizards, I’ve killed countless times. It’s anachronistic to judge skill by rank. How much hell you have experienced, how life and life are divided depending on it.”
The wizard walked away, revealing the five rings on his right hand.
The man holding the sword said nervously.
“Hey, you know I asked first?”
“Doesn’t it matter? Anyone can go as long as they have the skills. Wasn’t that the rule?”
The wizard in front of Gaold waved his right hand and gestured for him to come in.
“I will teach you the state of those who have escaped the water supply.”
Gaold’s index finger aimed at him.
The moment the air gun exploded with a bang, the magician’s body crashed into the wall. He spurted blood and hit his butt on the floor, his head bowed deeply and he could not move any further.
“next.”
Shirone frowned.
He didn’t intend to kill him like he did in the association’s underground bunker, but he knew the power of Gaold’s air gun better than anyone else.
“I also agree with what he said earlier.”
An elderly wizard walked to the center, easing his neck.
“There is a level beyond the number of degrees. But to those who are not backed by their skills, theories are just delusions. I’d be a little different… … !”
At the same time as the magician’s face crumpled to one side, the back of Gaold’s hand, which had cast teleportation, hit his face and passed by.
The wizard, whose head shook left and right like a punch bowl, collapsed like a piece of wood.
“next.”
In an instant, none of the five people who watched two people drop out did not move.
It is not a team that simply dreams of making a fortune on the outskirts of heaven.
It was apparently a task force with business in heaven.
When no one came forward, Gaold pointed to the swordsman who was sitting with his sword in his arms.
“Hey, you. Didn’t you order something earlier?”
The swordsman kept his mouth shut and glared at Gaold.
Then he suddenly relaxed his expression and raised both hands as if he couldn’t be defeated.
“Whoops, give up. Acknowledging your skills is also… … ! Aww!”
Gaold, who came running like a dog, slapped his fist.
As the press magic exploded on the swordsman’s chin, his face bounced off in the direction of the hit and slid across the ground.
“Anyway, all of them have only their snouts alive.”
The atmosphere in the room rapidly cooled.
Gaold looked back at the other four, who were staring blankly at him, then turned his head toward the door and said,
“All off. If you don’t want to get lost.”
No matter who said it first, the four of them rushed out the door, struggling from limb to limb.
With only those who passed out and Shirone’s party remaining, a chilly aura hung over the warrior’s room.
Gaold shook his hands and turned to the door.
“it’s okay. It’s neat.”
“There is still one more left.”
Mahatu entered the warrior’s room.
Certainly, his skills would be one step above those who were here, but in Gaold’s opinion, going to heaven was too much.
“what? Are you a challenge too?”
“no. in fact… … .”
Mahatu hesitated and looked out the door.
“There is one more messenger of God. He asked me not to let any more warriors in… … .”
“yes?”
As Mahatu opened the way, a familiar man entered.
It was Armin of Gwangan, the Eternal Reflector.
“Oh my.”
To catch big fish, you need good bait.
As expected, Siena was perfect for capturing Armin.
Siena’s eyes turned cold.
How long do you have to be treated like a child to get your intuition resolved?
However, when he saw Armin’s face, his tone did not come out as harsh as he thought.
“Why is my brother here? Did you forget what I asked for?”
“No, I remember. I didn’t come here with the intention of interfering in your life. To keep my promise to myself.”
Gaold said.
“Sorry, but that won’t work. I don’t work with the white line. I can’t figure it out.”
“The ivory tower has withdrawn. Isn’t that what happened?”
Siena’s eyes widened.
If he had thrown away the magical utopia that only the best wizards in the world could enter, it would mean that his resolution was not normal.
“Uh, why? And Keira… … .”
Armin kept quiet about what was going on inside. However, a look of heaviness passed over his face.
“Siena, nothing in the world is more important than you. Heaven is a dangerous place. You can never go to a place like that alone. Even for the people of the Olipher School who raised me.”
“Siena-san is a certified 5th grade wizard.”
“Mr Kuan… … .”
Siena was surprised that the taciturn Kuan had opened her mouth.
“I know roughly what kind of relationship it is, but I feel like I’m ignoring it too much. And you don’t have to worry about Mr. Siena’s life or death. No one will die until I die.”
The wizard is a position that must survive until the end of the party.
As a swordsman, the fact that they died first, regardless of their skills, hurt their pride.
‘Is it Kuan… … .’
A demon of the sword who cut down two people against the continent’s strongest swordsman group Fengzhang.
It seems that such a person took good care of Siena.
It was a comforting fact in a situation where he had to follow the madman Gaold, but as an older brother, he couldn’t help but feel sad.
‘Well, with what qualifications do I… … .’
Except for Siena, everyone seemed to welcome Armin’s joining.
A master of time magic who conquered the speed of light.
In particular, the stop magic that stops time was the world’s strongest crowd control.
“Okay, if it has nothing to do with the white line, I accept it. But anyway, I’m in charge. If you disobey, I will remove you from the team, so please know that.”
Armin had no complaints either.
Since Siena was held hostage, fighting for the team was the best way.
With the flight to heaven just around the corner, a final team of 10 members was formed to recapture the labyrinth.
‘Wow, it’s really amazing when you put it all together.’
Shirone couldn’t believe that he belonged to the team.
Regardless of white, red, black, it was a task force with the best people gathered.
* * *
Mahatu gave away all the remaining rooms.
The 10 people who each got a separate room had dinner and gathered in the largest room as a conference room.
The opening time for the Guffin’s door is 6:00 AM tomorrow.
Considering the association’s pursuit, leaving immediately is the way to go, but even if you go over anyway, you’ll have to sleep first.
After entering heaven, even taking a break could be a war, so I preferred to spend the night here.
Gaold unfolded the map Gangnan had given him on the table.
It was a spray chart with colored dots on a map of heaven.
“Heaven is currently going through a cataclysmic period. A revolution has broken out among the subjects, and rebels are active. What you see now is a real-time threat map with Level 2 or higher alert zones displayed. Oh, I must leave out the word real-time. Because it was three months ago.”
Gaold’s Royal Guard, who were on a spy mission in heaven, had no further contact until the last time they sent this map.
Sein said.
“As a result of confirming Eastas, it became necessary to revise the existing strategy. Checking the maze’s condition is the first priority. In some cases, changing the coordinates of the Akashic Records may not make sense.”
Ethella said.
“If Miro was kidnapped from heaven, shouldn’t the enemy’s status be reset? It means that you are already preparing yourself.”
“yes. A preemptive strike through stealth is difficult. I’ll have to look at the situation, but I’ll use the strategy of infiltrating after causing as much disturbance as possible.”
said Armin.
“Creating a disturbance in heaven? There won’t be many ways. Are you planning to use the rebels?”
“That, too, is clearly in my head. But the rebels won’t move easily. So what you need is the ancient weapon Tagis. If we can neutralize Heaven’s interception system, ‘Aegis’, they will change their minds.”
Armin shook his head.
“no. Even if they could break through the Aegis, there is little chance that the rebels will launch an all-out war. As most of them were subjects, they must know the power of heaven better than anyone else. If Mecca and Norr were united, it would be a force that could not be overlooked even by Heaven, but the problem is fear. Imprinted fear is not easily forgotten.”
“Fear can be eliminated. Anyway, the trend of heaven will be far away from our expectations. You have to deal with it from time to time. After all, we have the Masterpiece.”
Siena asked.
“What does it mean? Masterpiece?”
Sein looked back at Shirone.
“It is you, Shirone. If you succeed, you can create an effect equivalent to moving the entire rebel army. So let’s listen now. How the hell are you going to blow up heaven?”
When everyone’s eyes suddenly focused on her, Shirone gulped down her saliva with a nervous expression.
It is a part that must be explained before leaving for heaven, but the atmosphere was different from when I told Gaold.
From now on, it was a real battle where every word was a strategy.
Gaold shoved his chin as if he were vouching for it.
“Hehe, there is no need to hesitate, Shirone. In my opinion, it’s really crazy magic.”
‘That’s why I’m more anxious… … .’

Chapter - 413 - Task Force (5) 13.txt
===============================
[413] Task Force (5)
“It’s okay to talk, Shirone. Because it’s just a home. We will listen and judge.”
Encouraged by Zulu’s words, Shirone repeated the explanation given to Gaold.
“First of all, it’s magic based on Ataraxia.”
“Of course it is.”
It was best to start with Ataraxia to get even a 1% chance of Shirone destroying Heaven.
“The casting direction will be set to the sky. That’s why we spread a magic circle over her head.”
“Hoo? Is it the sky?”
It was definitely the beginning of a unique way.
As everyone’s expectations rose, Shirone continued.
“Ataraxia is a trigger magic, so the range is not fixed. I thought the way to shoot into the sky was the most effective way to maximize that advantage.”
“understood. then… … What are you going to shoot?”
“Laser.”
“laser?”
Everyone here knows what a laser is.
But the sky was too empty to destroy anything.
“yes. I will amplify the linearity of the laser with ataraxia and shoot it as high as possible.”
Fleur asked.
“If it is a high place, how high is it?”
“Well, it’s a simple calculation, but roughly… … About 6,000 kilometers.”
“Six, six thousand?”
Siena said.
“With a laser, it is possible. Because it is a single straight wavelength. If you combine Ataraxia’s amplifying power and the characteristic called trigger, then higher altitudes are probably possible. So, Shirone?”
Shirone began to explain in earnest.
“At an altitude of 6,000 kilometers, we will cast a dark ball through the laser’s information transmission method. It is to compress God’s particles to a high degree, and if you use Ataraxia, you can make a mass of about 10 tons on a planetary scale.”
Chee Hee Hee!
Sein’s Iron Wheel quickly returned.
Even after listening to this, I realized what Shirone was planning to do.
In his head, all sorts of formulas began to be computed in a complicated but precise manner.
Shirone spread her arms wide.
“Perhaps a form of creativity? Actually, the shape is not important, but based on the omnipotence, it seems so, so a spear shaped with light weighing 10 tons is born. And that… … .”
Said Sain who finished the calculation.
“It’s falling.”
“yes. That’s all.”
That’s all.
And everyone was speechless.
A much simpler mechanism than you might expect.
But surprisingly, it contained enough ideas to destroy Heaven.
“But is it really possible?”
Gaold turned to Sein at Fleur’s question. From now on, it was up to his Servant brain to judge.
“possible.”
Said Sein.
“Simply put, a mass of 10 tons falls from an altitude of 6,000 km. If the gravity of heaven is similar to that of this place, it will take about 14 minutes to reach it. The mass window will accelerate further under the influence of gravitational acceleration, and when it reaches its terminal velocity it will exceed 14 kilometers per second.”
Flew’s eyes widened.
“Fourteen kilometers? Second speed?”
If it moves at a speed of 14 kilometers per second, it is impossible to respond from the moment it enters the line of sight.
And the result was a quantification of the power that a 10-ton spear pierced at 41 Mach.
“It will be like that. Even if the kinetic energy generated there alone is converted into explosive power, it is approximately 2.19 million kilobusters. It’s a figure that exceeds Heaven’s durability. If it gets stuck in Arabot in the center, all seven heavens will be razed to the ground.”
If it was Sein’s words, there would be no error in the calculation.
Even so, no one could take the figures that came out now into their hearts.
2.19 million kilobusters?
It was beyond common sense that a boy who was still only a student could wield such power.
“Hey, how are you? I told you it was insane magic.”
Gaold said.
“You know what I liked the most when I first heard this? There are no awkward assumptions. There is a clear distinction between what can be done and what cannot be done. At most, I thought that the senior year guy would talk nonsense, but that wasn’t the case. It is not Shirone’s magic that destroys heaven.”
Sein said.
“Universal gravitation. The gravity of the planet draws in the spear and destroys Heaven itself.”
“That’s right. Those who worshiped the gods will eventually perish at the hands of the gods. It’s called ‘God’s punishment’.”
Shirone turned to Gaold.
“I was going to do it with Shining Spear?”
“The name doesn’t matter. Anyway, the problem is the trajectory, the landing point, and the time.”
Sein said.
“That I can count. I’ll make a chart as soon as I get to heaven. In three days or so, we’ll have a good idea of the motions of the planets, so we’ll just have to set the launch time then.”
Everyone began to articulate new strategies and tactics to accommodate the new parameters.
God’s Punishment had such a powerful ripple effect that the project’s strategy was completely changed.
While everyone was having a heated discussion, only Siena was looking at Shirone happily.
Gaold seemed to like that the divine punishment used the nature of the natural world, but Siena had the exact opposite idea.
We all know that dropping 10 tons from an altitude of 6,000 kilometers has tremendous destructive power.
But the reason no one is trying is because to lift 10 tons, potential energy equivalent to kinetic energy is required.
Therefore, God’s punishment was Shirone’s magic, not universal gravitation.
The laser is amplified by Ataraxia, and information is transmitted to Godot, where it activates God Particles to gather mass.
Looking at the results, it is a simple mechanism, but it was an application that would have been impossible for Shirone, who started from a blank slate, without a perfect understanding and analysis of what he had.
‘You’ve squeezed out every last drop.’
The best result that was created after compressing the ideas in my head like diamonds so that there is no gap.
That’s why Siena was able to sincerely congratulate the disciple on his great leap.
“But there are conditions.”
Said Shirone, cutting off the heated discussion.
“Ataraxia was given to me by Archangel Ikael. Therefore, you must meet Ichael before casting this spell. And I know it was a contract.”
No one is foolish enough to break a contract between team members.
However, it was human nature to want to turn a blind eye for a while at the point of obtaining the extremely high-efficiency weapon of God’s Punishment.
No matter how cool-headed the old man was, the same was true.
In order for Divine Punishment to be activated, Ikael must be brought into contact with Shirone.
Depending on the situation, it may be very easy, or it may be impossible.
Regardless of the level of difficulty, Sein did not like that uncertainty.
“I will keep the contract. Also you deserve our help. But is that really the only option? If you give up on Ikael, I might do something similar to that. For example, with the assumption that all of us will be wiped out, we will prioritize your survival.”
If you can get rid of the uncertainty, that’s better.
That was the amount of God’s punishment that Sain thought of in the project.
“no. I won’t meet Ichael until it puts everyone in danger. But if it’s not dangerous, there’s no need for God’s punishment. Even so, if it becomes dangerous, then there is enough motivation to meet Ikael. Please know that in such a limited situation, there is no need to bind Ichael and God’s Punishment with other restrictions.”
“Hmm, that’s what it meant.”
If it’s a situation that will destroy heaven, it means that the situation has already been cornered.
If even a small probability was to be caught, the case of Shirone meeting Ikael was also considered.
“good. I will be content with the safety of my teammates being independent of Ikael’s tangent.”
It was the best line that Sein and Shirone could come to an agreement on.
* * *
the next morning.
Ten members of the team gathered in front of Guffin’s door.
Kergo chieftain Mahatu and priests surrounded him, and warriors gathered in two columns to see off the Heaven Expedition.
When Shirone opened the Immortal Function, the Guffin’s door disintegrated into particles and turned into a huge space-time tunnel.
While everyone was shouting Ankera, Gaold moved on with an annoyed expression.
Maybe it’s a return to the beginning of everything.
“I will destroy your gods.”
Raising his terrifying eyes, Gaold pushed himself into the black orb without hesitation.

Gangnan’s expression as he watched Gaold disappear was indifferent, but his heart was throbbing like never before.

Since Miro left, Gaold has become a crippled person, but Sein was jealous of him for being able to be insane.
Those were the days of running madly for the sake of the labyrinth.
‘You just need to find a maze. You don’t have to worry about anything other than that. Even if the world ends… … .’
Sein’s body fell into the black sphere.
‘I save the labyrinth.’

Armin looked back at Siena in front of Guffin’s door.
Just seeing Kuan by his side made his heart ache.
‘I’m sure you did too.’
I could understand a little how she felt about having to watch Keira as a loving couple.
‘But it was for you. Even to prove it, I will stand by your side.’
Armin turned quickly as if to erase his thoughts and disappeared through the Guffin’s door.
Even if the end of the world was beyond this, there was no reason to hesitate.

Kuan looked at Siena’s back as she walked away.
As a swordsman, the lives of all nine people are beyond his own death.
Perhaps the probability that he will return alive is slightly higher than the possibility that all 10 people will miraculously return to life.
Even so, the reason I didn’t feel dirty was probably because I wanted to protect someone for the first time.
‘Is this my grave?’
A cool smile appeared on Kuan’s lips as he turned to Saji.

Shirone watched until the end as all the team members left for heaven. And he looked back as if looking back at the years gone by.
Life so far passed by like a kaleidoscope.
‘Hello everyone.’
At the end of life, we meet the beginning of life.
For Shirone, this journey meant just that.
Now come, there can be no fear.
Even if I lose everything, I thought of pouring everything in heaven so that I wouldn’t regret today’s judgment.
“Go, messenger of God.”
Receiving Mahatu’s greeting, Shirone passed the warriors’ path and arrived at the Guffin’s Gate.
The tunnel of dark spheres did not show what was beyond. Just like everyone’s future, only distant uncertainty lingers around.
‘From now on, I won’t even look back!’
Shirone opened her eyes and ran into the Guffin’s door.
The space-time barrier distorted with powerful force swallowed Shirone and threw her into a world that humans could never reach.

Chapter - 414 - Second Purgatory (1) 1.txt
===============================
[414] Second Purgatory (1)
The Arun Mountains located in the northeast of Tormia Kingdom.
In this place full of gloomy aura from ancient times, there is Belkyr’s seal, which was sealed a long time ago.
Just as there was magic even when you didn’t know magic, it was the mages who dealt with the law who sealed the demons.
But now, thousands of years have passed, the will of good has faded, and the evil of Belkir has gradually entered the gap and started to encroach on the law.
This is the story of Belkyr’s resurrection.
The majesty of Belkyr, which broke through the 20-meter-thick underground bedrock and appeared in the hollow of the mountain range, was overwhelming.
Its huge body, which was 15 meters tall and weighed 32 tons, resembled an octopus, and its skin was dark as if it had rotted.
The two arms looked like human beings, but if you look closely, they were a combination of colorful snakes.
Its reptilian, ferocious face had only red flames imprinted on its pupilless eye sockets.
Burning the dot of flame, Belkyr tumbled over the 24 legs of the octopus like a wave.
– I will destroy the world! I will subjugate all creatures under my feet!
That is the only law that makes up Belkyr.
But the big star of thousands of years ago had to feel the futility of time.
Humans who had achieved civilization were no longer easy enough to perish at the appearance of a single demon.
The mage sect, which had previously identified the location of demons based on ancient documents, sent an official letter of cooperation to the Ministry of Defense of the Kingdom.
A cage-level party was organized with the King’s approval, and 21 wizards entered the caves of the Arun Mountains.
Now, 8 hours and 37 minutes have passed since then.
Cage B Team, which consisted of official 4th grade to 6th grade, amputated all of Belkyr’s legs and was putting on a final offensive for complete extinction.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Belkyr crawled through the cave, struggling with his arms entangled in snakes.
Although it is a Demon God equipped with all kinds of regenerative abilities, the power emitted by 21 humans was not at the level that he who was active thousands of years ago could handle.
“Insignificant humans! How dare you like me! Aaaaagh!”
Belkyr’s body dented in the shape of an X, and as the flesh split open, slimy liquid spurted out.
The fat bald man jumped into the wound and began swinging his two tanning knives even faster.
“Is the letter X a decoration? uh? decoration? uh? decoration? uh? decoration?”
Currently, 28 kinds of super-powerful buffs were applied to the man.
His arm showed no sign of stopping, and endlessly opened the flesh in an X shape, digging into the heart.
A blush turned on the man’s face when he discovered a light purple muscle mass.
And bit the demon’s heart.
“Aaaaaagh! delicious! So delicious!”
I pulled the heart straight with my teeth and cut the connected part with a razor blade and struck it, and the flesh fell off.
The moment I passed it down my throat, the intense flavor of the raw meat spread and firecrackers exploded in my head.
“Oooh! Oohhhh!”

“Turn it off… … !”
Belkyr held out until the end.
Ordinary living beings would die as a matter of morality if they suffered this much.
I could see how tenacious and obsessive the concept of demons was born.
“I-I can’t disappear like this… … .”
“sorry. I’m so sorry.”
A woman with a pale face and gray hair that hung down to her waist shed tears as she hugged Belkyr.
Every time her hand stroked the demon’s body, the wriggling flesh stopped working.
“How much does it hurt? how painful would that be Hehehe! sorry. I can’t help… … Hee hee hee!”
An unbearable laugh broke out between the sobbing voices.
The contrast between the big eyes that shed tears and the grotesquely twisted corners of the mouth was chilling.

In the human world, to the point of being called a demon, it was a position equivalent to a two-legged mara in heaven, but now it was just a demon in danger of being destroyed at the same time as the advent of only 21 humans.
Belkyr finally realized that he had been imprisoned.
The magicians’ abilities sealed themselves off like ours and beat them for 8 hours.
When the devil was in trouble, Rose, the team leader of Cage Team B, went to the main dealer.
As expected, he was preoccupied with smoking in the corner and goofing around.
“hey! Can’t you come in soon? Do you know how much this party costs per hour? Does the association give you money by digging the ground?”
“Ah, that witch.”
Tarvan shook off his cigarette and looked at Belkyr.
It was clearly compacted and in perfect condition to be destroyed.
‘Stop messing around, you jingling bastard.’
Tarvan spread his hands as he rushed towards Belkyr, and a high frequency sound pierced his eardrums from the top of his palms.
Kaiser Blast.
All the wizards who heard this name scattered in all directions.
As Tarvan’s hands extended forward, Belkyr’s heavy body began to vibrate.
“Remember, humans! I am… … !”
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
At the same time as the explosion, Belkyr’s shape disappeared without a trace.
Flesh splattered everywhere, but even that melted in the heat.
“Mission complete.”
It was the result that came out exactly 8 hours and 49 minutes after Cage Team B arrived here.
At that time, the eyes of the communications wizard, who had been dozing with his back leaning against the cave wall, opened.
Information was output on the crystal ball in front of me.
It took roughly four hundred lines of code to convey just one sentence.
“manager. manager.”
As Rose turned around, the communication wizard floated a crystal ball over her palm and said,
“It’s an association call. Gather all of Team B in the cage.”
Magic Association.
The hallway on the 18th floor, where the president’s office was located, was full of wizards.
Team B’s face was full of dissatisfaction as they were all scattered and waiting for the team leader.
Basically, Cage B Team is made by selecting only the best performers in each field.
It’s no exaggeration to say that they were the busiest wizards in the kingdom, so it was natural that they weren’t happy to be called after the mission was over.
“What are you anxious about? I need to go home soon and look after the baby. Are you sure you don’t intend to do anything more here?”
“By the way, why doesn’t the team leader come out like this? Do you know anything, old man?”
Tarvan asked Horkin.
Cage, the eldest member of Team B and the person in charge of the order, would know something, but he just smiled dubiously.
When the door to the president’s office opened and Rose came out, wizards rushed towards her.
As expected, it was not a good thing, but her expression was not good.
“Team leader, what did the president of the association say?”
Currently, Rufist temporarily serves as the president of the association, but those who are not members of the association do not care whoever takes over as the president, as long as the settlement is done properly.
“It is an urgent mission. I guess you guys should run one more time.”
No one said a word, but the hallway shook uneasy with the cold blood shooting from their gaze.
Saint Moriac asked.
“Why us? There is also a cage A team, right?”
There is almost no difference in skill between Cage A and Cage B.
No matter how top of each field, Tormia’s defense power is not so weak that there are not 40 such talented people.
However, if Team A of Cage worked together for a long time, Team B of Cage was an improvised member depending on the situation at that time.
In that minor difference, there is no choice but to be in the middle of the day.
If they had to carry out the mission of the association this time, the target would be the Cage A team, not themselves.
“I also suggested. But currently, Cage Team A is temporarily unavailable.”
said Horkin.
“It’s because of Gaold.”
“that’s right. Currently, Team A has a person presumed to be Gaold’s bodyguard. Until the truth is uncovered, we are the only cage-level party in the kingdom.”
Tarban said.
“Still, it can’t be done. Isn’t it the team leader who asked for a contract from the beginning? And this friend of Roche has a daughter who can’t even stretch yet. She is beaten to death by Jesu.”
“That’s right, chief. please take me out Even if I had to pay a penalty… … .”
Rose’s eyes narrowed.
“Don’t be mistaken. This is not a guild. Settlement is just an example given at the association level. Currently, the first-class mobilization order of the kingdom has been declared. Failure to do so will result in disqualification from the red line and be punished according to the laws of the kingdom. Do you know what the kingdom atmosphere is like right now? You better know how to crawl.”
The wizards were silent.
Anyway, leaving the red line, I couldn’t think of their location, so in the end, I had to remove them from above.
Rose’s expression softened a little.
“As the team leader, I am sorry. However, when this mission is over, the association also promised a sufficient reward. You will be able to get three times the original down payment and reputation points equal to the special promotion.”
Money is money, but the words of reputation points changed the eyes of the wizards.
From the official 6th grade, the number of points to be accumulated for promotion was enormous, so if this task was successful, it would be a solid hold on one’s share.
Horkin asked.
“so… … What are we supposed to do?”
Rose kept quiet as if this was a problem.
Isn’t the level of difficulty too high, no matter how cage-level?
“This target is… … It is human.”
“human? Who is the human?”
Rose’s eyes flashed sharply.
“The former president of the Tormia Magic Association, Mikea Gaold is eliminated.”
* * *
Purgatory outside Heaven. Forest of the Vulnerable.
After coming out of the tunnel where the light flowed like a torrent, a vast expanse opened up before Shirone’s eyes.
The concentric circles of heaven were visible beyond the sea of floods, and drones were clustered like gnats in a certain section.
Having already experienced it, Shirone took a deep breath and prepared to land.
As expected, the direction sharply changed and it fell vertically.
The sea disappeared and the forest passed by.
I watched with my eyes wide open until the ground was right in front of me, then I twisted my body.
“Whoa.”
It was a much more stable landing than before, but no one congratulated Shirone.
The nine people who passed through the Guffin’s door first were scattered, looking in different directions, lost in thought.
Sein said.
“It is the forest of the profane. It is the habitat of monopods.”
“Single ears. It’s a quiet place. Shall we go then?”
secluded place.
Shirone recalled the situation in which she had been surrounded by poisonous ears.
Thanks to that, I was able to meet Kanya and Lena and enter heaven, but it was never a safe place.
‘Well, it might be a secluded place for these people… … .’
Sein explained as he walked.
Purgatory is largely classified into three places: the habitat of cults, the mainland, and the outskirts of the community.
In particular, the outskirts of the community is a general term for the areas where non-subjects live, and they are specially called borderline people.
Sein’s current destination is a place called the mainland, and since it is the only neutral zone where heretics and vigilantes gather, it was a place he had to stop by to get information.
As I passed through the middle of the forest, the ground suddenly started shaking as if an earthquake had occurred.
The party, who was on alert, waited for a new change to appear, and as the sound gradually died down, they exchanged glances and made their way through the forest.
“oh my god… … .”
Hundreds of giants formed a line in the plain below the mountain and were heading somewhere.
A giant created through Anecdotal Sake.
At the time, they were shocked by the mere existence of giants and didn’t have time to think about it, but according to Sein’s explanation, they were currently on their way to Jotunheim, the land of giants.
There, he regains his identity and returns to heaven to keep the law, but if he falls, he cannot come to heaven and is banished to the land of fire called Muspel.
“A giant is also a power that cannot be ignored. But they are just monsters. I’d rather ignore him and go.”
The faces of the 10 people who were stuck in the bush disappeared without a sound.

[415] Second Purgatory (2)
Shirone and the others proceeded towards the mainland.
It would be faster to travel by Zulu’s summoned beast, but it wasn’t a good choice as we didn’t know about the conflict in Purgatory.
In particular, since the sky of Heaven is a place where angels, Maras, and drones are active, I wanted to avoid situations where I could be captured from a distance greater than the radius of Ethella’s Spirit Zone.
But contrary to their expectations, the forest of the profane was very quiet.
It was a surprise to them, who imagined angels patrolling the sky and defeating heretics and rebels.
Gangnan asked.
“How can I interpret this? An unexpected change? Or proof that the rebels were destroyed?”
“Either way is possible.”
At Sain’s words, Fleur tilted her head.
“Is there a possibility that the forest will be quiet without the rebels being destroyed?”
“Common sense, it’s impossible. But if you think like that, the maze disappeared as well. Anything can happen. We still have to see it that way.”
Sein felt the sense of incongruity felt in the maze’s space-time again.
No, the fact that even the situation in purgatory was different from what was expected made her more anxious.
‘It’s something I’ve been designing with bated breath for 20 years. But why is it going so wrong?’
Can I really trust my current senses?
Maybe this too is a coincidence. Because anyone can check the result and fit the cause there.
Sein made a simple conclusion.
‘Let’s not think hard. Both situations need to be calculated. I can do it.’
“There is someone.”
Ethella stopped and looked to the right.
Of course, I didn’t feel it nearby. A variety of information flowed in from the Spirit Zone spanning a radius of two kilometers.
About 20 people are moving, displaying motility beyond the normal range.
The sound of weapons colliding with each other and the sound of explosions came through synesthesia.
“I think we are in a battle. It’s about 800 meters away.”
Flew asked, looking out of the corner of her eye at Gaold.
“Are you sure?”
It meant that I needed approval to raise my mobility.
Since the current situation in the forest was different from what was expected, holding your breath would be an option, but Gaold chose the straight attack method.
“Check.”
At the same time as the instructions were issued, the entire team turned into a flash of light and disappeared.
Kuan and Gangnan were moved by Zulu, and except for Shirone, they were all pros, so there was no problem navigating the complex forest.
Shirone also conquered the master difficulty of movement control in the senior class, but the difference in level was clear depending on the grade.
In particular, the movements of Gaold, Sein, Zulu, and Armin, who were in the lead, were escaping the complex terrain like ghosts, as if reminiscent of the movement of aircraft.
‘How long does it take to train like that?’
Upon arriving at the scene, the silence from before had disappeared and a loud sound was filling the forest.
“Follow me! Take out their hearts!”
“Kyayayayayaya!”
The Kergos, clad in black armor, were chasing after the Mechas, emitting a distinctive groan.
Their movement as they ran together with the horse was like a gale, but the speed of the Meccans was not easy to catch.
‘What is that?’
The mobility of the Mecha tribe was coming from a mechanical device connected to a bony skeleton mounted outside the body.
A skeleton ran across the shoulder line at the back of the back to the arms, then ran down the spine from the neck down to the legs.
According to the movement of the wearer, Ching! Ching! The joint joints were rotating with a refreshing sound, but each time they hit the ground, the jumping distance increased by 5 meters and 6 meters.
“Piper, a strength aid. These are Mecca fighters.”
The Mechas flew around the forest as if springs were attached to the soles of their feet.
But the Kergos are also excellent hunters.
One of them, who unknowingly put the Mecca under siege, burst out of the forest like a surprise and brandished a sword.
“Huh!”
A Mecca member held out an Xd.
The hologram shield spread and created a shock wave, but schema’s physical strength was slightly superior, and he stumbled and fell to the floor.
Mecha soldiers gathered around their fallen comrades and looked around.
The Kergos, who had blocked the escape route before they knew it, were revealing themselves one by one, surrounding them in all directions.
The short-haired woman who is the leader of the Mecha tribe whispered into her mouth the drone mounted on her wrist.
“This is the 2nd reconnaissance team. Currently under siege by the Kergos. I wish you support.”
No answer came.
However, due to the nature of radio communication, it could not be guaranteed that the request for support did not go through.
‘please please… … .’
At a distance of 20 meters from him, Shirone and the others were watching the situation.
The Kergos are proud of their excellent pursuit skills, but they couldn’t use much power in front of Sein’s Equilibrium.
In a state where even the sound of breathing was ground inside the iron wheel and dropped to a silent level, the five senses were useless.
Kang Nan turned to Gaold and asked.
“Where are you going? Kergo? Mecca?”
It was the first turning point they encountered after coming to heaven.
The subjects are classified into three races: Kergo, Mecha, and Nor, and each has a different fighting method, culture, and way of thinking.
Depending on which race you start with, the process of reaching the maze will be completely different, so you need to be careful.
rustle.
The bush swayed and Kergo warriors patrolling the outskirts of the formation appeared.
The warrior opened his eyes wide with a heart-stopping face.
It was natural to be surprised to see 10 people suddenly standing in a place where nothing could be captured even with the sensory system schema.
Heading back to where his comrades were, he raised his lungs and shouted.
“female… … .”
Gaold’s hand swung quickly.
“feather… … !”
With a pop, the Kergo warrior’s face flew away.
Shirone and Fleur stared blankly at the shivering muscular body without a face, then came to their senses.
If restraining one’s emotions and making rational judgments and putting them into practice is a normal human reaction, then Gaold’s reaction just a moment ago was extremely mechanical.
“If you think you have to kill someone according to your own judgment under any circumstances, kill them. I do the rear end. Even if it was the wrong choice, I will consider it as the worst thing other than the death of a team member.”
It was, for example, the issuance of a license to kill Gaold.
It is a thoroughly correct method for the survival of the team members, but not even asking whether the judgment is right or wrong is something that can be said because it is a Gaold that can take and press down with force in any situation.
Also, this was almost the only reason he was chosen as the team’s commander.
Kang Nan looked sideways at Gaold and asked.
“Now that it’s like this, the race selection is Mecca?”
There are many values that are more important to humans than the death of others, but the Kergos are an organization bound by divine law.
Since he had already killed one person, the barrier to compromise was higher than in Mecca.
“For Anchera!”
Gaold’s eyes twitched in displeasure.
“I’m going to Mecca.”
As soon as the words fell, Kuan jumped out. Hitman was perfect for this kind of work.
“Squad leader! If we continue like this, we will be annihilated!”
The Meccans were barely holding on in the face of being beaten.
Piper compensates for muscle strength, but it is only a function limited to large muscles, so it was almost impossible to defeat the Kergo warriors, whose whole body is a weapon, in hand-to-hand combat.
“Retreat! I’ll take care of this place!”
The squad leader jumped to the limb.
He knew what a person caught in a heresy hunt would go through, but he had to buy a little time before he could expect reinforcements.
“Cut her limbs and bring her torso!”
Just hearing the words made my teeth tremble.
She wanted to run away even now, but the Kergo warriors who had already jumped over her head were swinging their swords to cut off her arms.
Whoa!
At that time, a strong flash blew, and a faint afterimage passed by the Kergo warrior.
“what… … !”
The woman’s eyes twinkled in shock.
The faces of the Kergo warriors were separating and falling away from their bodies like a cork being pulled out.
‘There are 7 people left.’
Spinning in the air, Kuan grasped the position of the remaining enemy.
Six people were killed with a single cut, and no one knew that there were 12 subtle changes in the process of the cut.
“Enemies! Kill!”
Only after losing half of their power did the Kergos realize the presence of the assailant and throw themselves at it.
Kuan’s body continued to move bizarrely while being bound by threads of external gravity that stretched out in three directions.
It vibrated like a pendulum, then suddenly jumped out, and blood spattered from the bodies of the four people who passed him.
‘Three more.’
Another warrior was decapitated.
‘2 people.’
The enraged Kergo squad leader’s eyes widened.
They also make full use of external gravity, but it is only an auxiliary means to slash the enemy. It was the first bizarre movement that made him feel like being ridiculed like Kuan.
“Don’t disdain Kergo’s skills!”
As the vice-captain swung the moon sword, Kuan’s line of movement bent like a magnet with like poles and flew past the vice-captain.
“haha! It took!”
Digging traps, the basis of Kergo tactics.
The horsehaired warrior who had been dormant beforehand lowered his sword to the flying Kuan.
“huh?”
But it didn’t feel like it was in my hand.
When I looked up, Kuan, who should have been within the radius of the sword, was floating in the air and did not move.
Kuan gave the ponytail warrior an annoyed glare, then slowly looked away.
At the same time, his body was spinning like a top, and he was dragged to the unit commander’s place as if a skein of thread was wound around him.
“Captain! back!”
Before the unit commander could react, Kuan’s sword cut his throat.
As the external gravity disappeared, he landed on the floor and threw his sword while spinning.
The sword, which flew faster than the arrow, pierced the ponytail warrior’s stomach and stuck into a tree.
When Kergoin was annihilated, the forest fell into silence.
It was a dazzling battle, but it happened in about 5 seconds at the most.
Shirone and the others entered the scene only then.
I was deeply admiring Kuan’s ability, which I had only heard about through rumors, but the face of the person concerned was distorted with irritation.
‘damn! How much garbage has a guy like me become?’
In the past, it would have been enough to cut down everyone before even one breath of external gravity was over.
But now, rather, there was only one person left, and the last treatment was nothing more than a temporary response using the secret sword.
“Kuan-san, are you okay? Even if you are injured… … .”
As Siena approached, Kuan hurriedly erased his expression. She had no intention of getting her sympathy from her.
“sorry. It seems that the balance is not perfect yet.”
Siena tilted her head.
As a sorceress, she could never know what Kuan had done wrong.
After thinking for a moment, she just said what she had prepared.
“It was amazing. I haven’t seen much of the swordsman’s technique, but I think I’ve broadened my perspective this time.”
It was rather embarrassing to Kuan.
As I passed by with a bitter smile, Siena looked back.
‘Did I do something wrong?’
Mechas, meanwhile, tensed their arms as Gaold approached.
Thanks to their appearance, lives were saved, but it was difficult to clearly identify Pia in Purgatory.
Above all, if a single swordsman had annihilated the Kergo unit, it would have to be seen that he was clearly outclassed with his skills.
“Who are you? Is it heresy?”
Gaold looked back at Sein.
Some of the team members have learned the language of Heaven, but more than half of them needed an interpreter.
When the woman’s words were finally understood by Sein’s spirit world magic, Gaold took a step further.
At the same time, the Mecca flinched back.
The piper attached to the body narrowed the angle of the joint joint by the distance it moved while making a clicking sound.

[416] Second Purgatory (3)
Gaold, who had invaded like a robber into the gap between the Mechas, looked down at them with high-handedness and asked.
“Are you rebels? Where is your headquarters?”
One of the reasons for going to the mainland was to find a key base for the rebels, so if you listened to them, it would save you a lot of trouble.
But unexpectedly, the woman’s face, which had been frightened just a moment ago, changed dramatically when she heard Gaold’s voice.
Jumping up, she raised the arc and shouted.
“It’s a military community! Raise your arms, everyone! We die here today!”
At the command of the squad leader, the members also took up a fighting posture.
With Cigna and Xd at the fore, their expressions showed their determination to even die.
“Get out of here right now! Otherwise, you will become Ark’s food.”
Ark’s laser aimed at Gaold’s forehead.
Mecha ranged weapon that shoots explosive orbs.
However, the woman knew that he was not an opponent.
‘Since I risked my life, I have no choice but to try blackmail.’
“haha. Kkkkkkkkk.”
As if the wind had entered his lungs, wrinkles appeared on Gaold’s face as he shook his shoulders and smiled.
And when he raised his head again, his eyes were blazing with a flame that was nowhere to be found.
“You’re babbling annoyedly.”
Great heat hell engulfed the Meccans.
It doesn’t matter if it’s misunderstood or misunderstood. Gaold was not a nice person enough to look kindly on those who dared to fight fearlessly.
All the Mecca members who fell into the superheated hell had pale faces and their legs trembled while drooling.
When I heard the demon’s scream, I was so horrified that I wanted to tear my eardrums apart.
It was not a kind of fear that humans could handle.
Even the woman, who had passed the life and death crisis several times as a squad leader, was all about sitting helplessly with her chin shaking.
“Huh. that stop please… … .”
It was only after the Meccans lost their will to fight that Gaold let go of his self-denial.
The tear-stained woman lifted her head and glared at him resentfully.
“Why are you bothering us? We’re fighting against Heaven. Aren’t you guys the same?”
“I don’t know what nonsense you’re talking about, but I don’t know if it’s the military community or what. And weren’t you the ones who called borderline people “mojo people” and belittled them from before?”
“That, that… … .”
Just as the woman was about to retort, trees began to fall in the forest behind the Meccans.
Everyone’s eyes turned to it.
It seemed like something huge was approaching at high speed, but I couldn’t see anything yet.
– Release the magnetic field. Start the argon engine.
As the landscape of the forest shimmered, an opaque boundary began to emerge.
What finally revealed its identity was a bipedal armored tank with a height of almost 4 meters.
The ratio of the upper body to the lower body is 1:1, and it has a sense of stability, and it has relatively long and thick arms on short legs with reverse joints.
The hydraulic cylinders were pumping at different cycles in sync with the sound of the engine.
-Enemy in sight. Preemptive strikes are allowed.
The chariot rushed forward with its four-fingered palm outstretched.
As Gaold stepped back, he leaned forward and slammed the ground. The soil stood up like an iron wall.
The tank, which was hit by the pouring soil, seemed unable to stand up on its own, judging from its shape and weight, but continued to move its legs forward and regained its center by scooping out about 2 tons of soil.
In the meantime, Shirone and the others spread their distance while maintaining their respective fighting distances.
Shirone also activated the Diamond Arms and put on a hood to keep an eye on the situation.
‘What is that?’
Each time the bipedal tank’s waist turned like oil floating on water, the c*ckpit at the top looked ahead.
The c*ckpit was an oval glass ball with an electrified purple sheen, so it was impossible to look inside.
“Guroi. It is the second stage equipment of the Mecha combat system.”
Gaold narrowed his eyes at Gangnan’s explanation.
“Oh, the real thing is definitely good.”
When I only checked the specifications with documents, I thought it was just a walking lump of scrap metal.
However, when I encountered it in real combat, it was a device that had excellent mobility and could be used tactically depending on the skill of the pilot.
In particular, the method of distorting the magnetic field to erase the sense of presence was a state-of-the-art technology that had not been described in documents until recently.
The upper part of the Kuroi spun and turned toward the Mecha.
“Is everyone in Squad 2 all right? What about Kergoin?”
The voice transmitted through the speaker was neutral, but judging from the tone, it was likely a male.
“The Kergos were annihilated. But not us.”
Kuroi’s c*ckpit returned to Gaold.
“Who are they?”
The woman chose her words for a moment.
The bearded man clearly said it was not a military community.
However, the fantasy he showed was tantamount to intangible violence that could not be inflicted without blind hostility.
It was to the point where I thought it would be better for me to go crazy than to go back to that hell again.
“The enemy attacked us.”
Kuroi gave instructions through internal channels.
– Sweep them out. Convert to strike mode. Raise the argon engine gear to level 5.
Chunk! Chunk! Chunk!
The five advancing Kuroi planes changed the shape of their hands all at once.
Four fingers folded outward, and a huge gun barrel with black holes protruded from the inside.
-Open fire!
Can-can-can-can-can-can-can!
A deafening roar was heard as the hundreds-kilogram iron cylinder, in which the ball played the role, swayed with great force.
Heavy bullets ricocheted at three hundred rounds per minute, bursting rocks and snapping trees.
A group of Kuroi turned to Gaold.
The black bullet flew rapidly to a distance of 30 cm in front of Gaold, then rapidly slowed down as if buried in something.
Puff! Fluffy!
Bullets that failed to penetrate the air shield were gathering, creating a black metal barrier.
“Hmm, it’s an iron ball.”
Gaold waited until the bullets lost their rotation before grabbing one with his hand.
Then, the perplexity of the Kuroi unit was transmitted through the shaking of the aircraft.
– Cow, Platoon Leader! I caught the bullet with my hand!
-Keep shooting! They are presumed to be borderline! Don’t judge your enemies by your experience so far!
Gaold, who was weighing the bullet in his hand, let it fly upwards with a thumbs-up.
“Something like an air gun. It will hurt quite a bit.”
Gangnan said with tears in his eyes.
“If you’re going to do it, don’t do it. Or am I?”
Gaold caught the falling bullet.
“take. I’ll have to try it myself.”
Kang Nan gritted his teeth at the nonsense, but he had no intention of overturning the commander’s decision.
“Is that so? Can you take it without damage?”
When Kang Nan looked back at Sein and asked, Cheoryun eyes began to turn.
“It is counting. It will take about a minute.”
Gangnan looked at the battlefield anxiously. It was because it seemed that one minute would be enough time to finish all five planes.
“shit! Who the hell are these people?”
The pilot of Kuroi Unit 3 was to die for.
In the AMOLED Vision installed in front of the c*ckpit, seven split screens cover the front 360 degrees, but it was difficult to capture the man with the sword as if he jumped between screens.
‘There are many strange things in this world.’
Kuan cut all over Kuroi.
Every time the sword was cut, the iron plate opened like flesh and sparked electricity.
‘Is it thicker than armor? Where did people hear it?’
When the engine artery was accidentally cut, Unit 3 lost its balance and stumbled.
“Keugh! This bastard!”
The pilot raised his arms and regained his balance.
Kuroi, which corresponds to the second stage of the mecha combat system, can operate only when it meets the first stage.
The first stage is none other than Piper, and since Kuroi’s operating organs are connected to each part of the pilot’s body, those who have not strengthened their muscles cannot easily move even one arm.
The pilot, who struggled with his limbs and finally found a sense of stability, searched for Kuan’s location.
But what caught his eye was not Kuan, but a cute woman with long brown hair and dark glasses.
“Cute bitch!”
Contrary to her appearance, she was a martial artist, and every time she landed a blow, Kuroi’s body shook and a roar exploded inside.
“OK! I will crush you to the bone!”
The pilot gritted his teeth and swung his fist.
As Kuroi’s waist accelerated, the thick gun barrel struck Ethella.
Whoops!
The pilot turned pale as he realized that his back could no longer be turned.
When I checked the multi-vision belatedly, the woman was blocking Kuroi’s gun barrel with her elbow raised to her face.
“Uh, how? One arm alone has 17 horsepower.”
“Whoa.”
Taking a deep breath and calming her arm muscles, Ethella turned to Guroi’s side.
Yin-Yang Wave Fist – Wall Mount.
When Kuroi’s leg was struck with a spear, the iron rang along with the waves, and a roar struck the pilot’s eardrums.
“Aaaagh!”
Unknowingly, when he grabbed his ear, Kuroi’s arms followed suit and collapsed forward.
-Damn it! What to do with that big-breasted girl! not human! It’s a monster!
-This way first! Only the engine artery is being picked and cut! Take care of the inspection!
“No, I’m asking who to catch first!”
Kanya, who looked left and right while turning around Kuroi’s waist, shouted with an annoyed expression.
Either way, it wasn’t a fuss.
bang! bang! bang!
Kanya’s one eye closed due to the shock transmitted to the aircraft.
Checking her vision with her other eye, she saw a tentacle monster flying through the forest with tentacles embedded in trees.
“That damned monster!”
Can-can-can-can-can-can-can!
Kuroi’s bullet broke all the trees in the area around which the tentacle monster was roaming.
In the meantime, the monster continued to fight by shooting light without a break.
Empty! Empty!
Every time it hit the light, dozens of tons of Kuroi shook, and the shock was fully transmitted to Kanya, who was connected to the piper.
“That really sucks!”
Wasting ammunition to catch a monster was not the only thing.
As the weapons of the rebels are reduced day by day due to the interference of the military community, pilots are selected only those who can perform strikes as efficiently as possible. It was the reason why she, the sharpshooter of the Ark, was able to board the Kuroi.
“Why such a monster… … !”
What annoys her more than anything is that the monster’s ability resembles the magic of a person she misses.
The incident in which Shirone stopped Ilhwa from drinking did not end with simply saving Kanya’s mother.
The wind he left behind has now become a huge typhoon and has become the conviction of the first principle of the rebels.
It was terribly unpleasant to recall memories with such a precious person by seeing that monster.
“No matter how many bullets it costs, I will definitely kill you!”
As all the trees around it were broken, Shirone’s range of activities became extremely narrow.
Realizing that there was no chance of winning in a long-term battle, Shirone pulled back her robe and began casting magic in earnest.
Like a retina, the light gathered in the center along the Spirit Zone turned into a red ray and shot at Kuroi’s leg.
Exploding the torso would be the most obvious, but the drive joints on the legs were suitable for striking during engagements.
-warning! Detect heat inside the aircraft! Cooling system on! Output limit exceeded!
“No, what are you talking about again?”
Kanya checked the instrument panel with wide eyes.
On the interface where Kuroi’s front view was drawn, the left leg was flashing red.
-Excessive energy output! Energy overload!
The output of the instrument panel went up endlessly.
At 240 percent, 370 percent, and finally 600 percent, the drive joint on the knee side cracked with a bang.
“Kyaaak!”
As Kuroi’s body tilted, the boarding seat fell to the ground.
The shock as if she had fallen from a building made her bones tremble, but Kanya did not let go of the control stick until the end.
“Die, monster… … huh?”
As the noisy AMOLED vision became clearer, the focus was automatically focused on the target at the point where the muzzle was aimed.
“What, what?”
Kanya doubted her own eyes.
The face of a boy who had appeared even in the dream was greatly magnified in the vision.

[417] Second Purgatory (4)
“Shirone?”
Kanya’s voice trembled.
It was definitely Shirone. But how is it here?
No, that didn’t matter anymore.
It meant that if the character on the screen was Shirone, he could bring new hope to the rebels in despair.
-Unit 5 collapsed! Cover!
After hearing the radio, Kanya finally came to her senses and turned her head to Multivision.
Most of the aircraft were immobilized, but there were still devices that could shoot bullets.
And all of them were aiming at Shirone.
“Wait, no!”
Kanya hurriedly pressed the radio button.
“You can’t shoot! I am not an enemy!”
When there was no response, she radioed and was not relieved. She checked on Shirone.
He was proudly showing off his courage.
“this… … !”
When the emergency escape button was pressed, the tempered glass in the c*ckpit flew forward with a bang.
After removing Piper from Kuroi’s synchro machine, Kanya crawled out of the bush and raised her hand.
“stop! Stop shooting!”
The voice of the platoon leader came from the speaker of Unit 5, which had escaped.
– Open fire.
Tick! Tick! Tick!
Kanya tightly closed her eyes, but the only thing she could hear from the remaining three Kuroi was the sound of steel bouncing.
“What, what?”
Looking around with a blank expression, Kanya realized that the scenery was distorting.
At the center of the distortion, a pair of gigantic cogwheels rotated in mesh.
Sein’s Equilibrium equalized the changes in the chemistry of the gas.
“misfire! It’s an unexploded round, Platoon Commander!”
“Me too. Check your spark plugs.”
“Nothing wrong! this… … ! Kuck!”
cooong!
Kuan and Ethella took down one Kuroi.
It took a long time compared to their skills, but it was meaningful that two people specializing in anti-biological warfare destroyed the machine with their physical abilities.
Kuroi’s tempered glass popped out.
The pilot passed out, clinging to the synchro machine, with Armin standing beside him.
As long as the coordinates were certain, it was the spookiness unique to space-time wizards who could penetrate even an enclosed space.
The other team members also destroyed the Kuroi easily, and the only surviving aircraft was the one Kuroi the platoon commander was riding.
Gaold approached Kuroi, stroking his chin with interest, as if meeting an unknown.
Then, instead of asking for a handshake, he looked up at the purple face of the aircraft and said.
“get off. Unless you want to die.”
Perong!
As the tempered glass soared to the ceiling, the platoon leader jumped at Gaold with the piper attached.
“die!”
“No, Platoon Commander!”
Kanya shouted, but the platoon leader’s Cigna was already falling on Gaold’s head.
“Canya?”
Gaold looked back at Shirone. And as if it were separate, his fist swung quickly and hit the platoon leader’s jaw.
“Aww!”
Falling in disgrace, he rolled on the floor with eyes open.
If Gaold hadn’t canceled the press magic, his face would have disappeared from the world with this blow.
“Anyone you know, Shirone?”
Shirone doubted his eyes and looked more closely.
“Is it Kanya? You, Kanya, right?”
Kanya seemed to have finally relaxed and moved on without power.
Empty! Empty! She, who even stripped her piper in the middle, ran with her bare body and fell into the arms of her Shirone.
“Shirone, Shirone! Aaaaaang!”
Everyone was bewildered when a sweet scene suddenly unfolded in the hostile relationship that had been fighting to death.
“really… … Shirone?”
Among the rebels, there is no one who does not know Shirone.
The first Nephilim to stop Ilhwa’s drinking.
The rebels were organized starting from the riots that started in Sharmaine District 73, and they honored Shirone by calling it ‘the light of District 73’.
Kanya belatedly wiped away her tears and smiled shyly.
“Sorry. I didn’t recognize him because he was wearing something strange.”
Shirone didn’t care, as anyone would have done that if they had met as enemies while hiding their identity.
“are you okay. How is Lena?”
“huh. It’s in the main unit. I will go black with joy when I see you.”
“haha! So, what about your parents?”
“Dad still corrects me.”
“… … I see.”
Shirone didn’t ask about her mother.
Even at that time, her lifespan was short, so it was possible to guess what happened after Kanya didn’t say anything.
There is no good death in the world.
However, Shirone hoped that she would leave happily, being seen off by her family.
“How long has it been since I went back?”
“Exactly 432 days.”
Kanya didn’t think long. The day Shirone stopped Ilhwa’s drinking was a monumental day for the rebels, so they didn’t even have to calculate it.
‘432 days.’
It was a time not too different from where Shirone lived.
There is no temporal error caused by the distance because the Guffin’s door distorts the space.
Even so, the reason why the time here is a little faster must be the influence of the gravitational field around the planet.
Shirone asked the most curious question.
“I heard that you are at war with Heaven, but I haven’t seen even Mara, let alone an angel, since I came here. Why is that?”
Kanya shook her head.
“We don’t know either. We fought really fiercely, no, we almost ran away, but somehow the angels started disappearing from one day. Even on the day of the full moon, when I was always on patrol.”
Sein, who had been listening while linking the mental magic, intervened with her eyes shining.
“When exactly did this change happen?”
“Um, maybe 130 days?”
130 days.
In contrast to the time zone of the original world, it was around three months or so.
It first occurred to me that it was then that I lost contact with Gaold’s bodyguards who had infiltrated heaven.
‘Surely something happened in heaven. What is it? Does it have anything to do with the maze? or not… … .’
The platoon leader looked at Kuroi with a bitter expression.
Shirone, called the light of District 73, didn’t have to fight for any reason, but the loss was too great.
“It’s a big deal. The damage to the aircraft is serious.”
Shirone approached with an apologetic expression. It was so damaged that it could not be repaired without window maintenance.
“sorry.”
“There is nothing to be sorry about. We were the ones who struck first.”
The squad leader woman, who had some responsibility for that, appealed by showing her palms with an unfair expression.
“But that man gave me a grotesque vision first. If you see it, you will understand, but anyone would have recognized it as an enemy.”
Flew took a beating.
“Before that, you aimed at the arc first, didn’t you?”
“Before that, that man started a fight first.”
“You misunderstood first before you started a fight.”
The woman could not stand it and cried out.
“Then how can you not misunderstand when you look like that! You approached me as if you were going to hit me!”
A moment of silence followed.
In the end, when the opinion that Gaold’s face was a sin came out, the platoon commander didn’t want to argue anymore.
“it’s okay. Stop that and quickly collect the aircraft and join the main unit. The main unit is also not in a relaxed situation right now.”
Sein asked.
“Where is the main unit?”
“Plains of the Dead. We are currently carrying out an operation to wipe out the giants.”
The platoon commander walked to his Kuroi.
“This is the only equipment that can be put in immediately. For now, I will lead, so follow me… … huh?”
Gaold stood behind the platoon leader.
When the platoon commander, with one foot on the aircraft, looked at him in disbelief, Gaold pointed to the side with his chin.
“Move. I will ride.”
“What are you talking about? Are you riding this?”
Kang Nan sighed and approached.
“Why the hell do you want to ride that? It’s linked to Piper anyway, so it won’t move even if you just ride it.”
Gaold’s solution was simple.
“Give me Piper, then.”
Kang Nan looked back at Se-in.
It was an official question to the team’s order, whether it was okay to leave this human alone.
Sein nodded.
Heaven is destroyed by Shirone, but Gaold must be in charge of the angels. He was the only one who could buy time against a bunch of angels, so he had better leave it to him when it came to fighting.
“For now, let them do whatever they want.”
5 minutes after that.
Chunk! Chunk!
Garold, equipped with a piper, boarded the Kuroi.
The platoon leader, deprived of everything, was just looking at the distant mountains.
Shirone looked at her anxiously and asked Fleur.
“Can I really do this? At best, the atmosphere was relaxed, but the stealing of equipment was a bit… … .”
“What are you thinking? Aren’t you the kind of person who would stop working just because you’re interested?”
Shirone shut his mouth.
Flew also felt remorse and eventually changed his mind.
“Actually, I don’t even know. But everyone here is the president of the association, so they followed us all the way here. I just trust the president of the association.”
Gaold connected Piper to the Synchro Machine.
As I closed my arms inside, Kuroi made the same motion.
“Are you feeling okay?”
Since there was no tempered glass, Gaold moved the tank while checking the scenery with his eyes.
“Hmm, how about this?”
When the drive joint on the waist was turned all the way, Kuroi’s waist began to spin like a top.
“Quack. Gangnan, look at this.”
When Gaold jokingly attacked with Guroi’s arm, Gangnan, who easily dodged it by leaning back, exclaimed unbearably.
“Oh really! I’m afraid I’ll break it!”
These were the words of those who had already destroyed four Kuroi, so Kanya ej*culated with sincere eyes.
“Please bear with that. The Kuroi is a really valuable piece of equipment.”
“Whoa, okay. I will die of stress because of that person.”
It was only then that Gaold took a look at this and that.
It’s not comparable to Spirit Zone’s synesthesia, but Multivision provided an excellent field of view, and its firepower was powerful enough to be compared to an air gun.
“How many guns are there in the rebels?”
“That is confidential. I can’t tell you.”
Kuroi’s gun barrel pointed at the platoon leader with a click.
I couldn’t tell how much of it was a joke and how serious it was.
“It’s also confidential, but I don’t know. At most, it’s about the status of the battalion’s equipment. There’s no way a platoon commander knows the total production of the rebels.”
Gaold licked his lips and stopped the aircraft.
He jumped off Kuroi, threw off his piper, and quietly joined Shirone’s group.
Kangnan crossed his arms and glared at him.
“why? It acted like it would ride all day.”
“I get motion sickness. Worse than words.”
Gangnan gasped and snorted.
On the other hand, Gaold’s mind was getting complicated.
‘I wouldn’t even have a chin on that one. At least 2,000? No, more than that.’
It was the strength of the Kuroi unit that Gaold had calculated was needed to capture one ordinary angel.
* * *
As the sun went down, Shirone and the others left the forest.
When I arrived at the hill overlooking the Plain of the Dead, the scene of the procession of giants I saw in the morning and the 23rd Battalion of the 1st Rebel Army commanding a local battle spread all the way to the horizon.
The battalion possessed a total of 30 Kuroi.
However, because one group Kanya belonged to was sent as reinforcements, twenty-five Kuroi were currently in operation.
Divided into five groups, the Kuroi troops cooperated with the infantry to lure a handful of giants at least one kilometer away from the column and then use concentrated fire tactics.
Every time the giants collapsed in pieces, Shirone put on a terrible expression.
Giants are also human.
If the Mecca members were once subjects, they would know that fact better than anyone else, so Kanya’s face was also shaded.
“The iron rule is to eliminate giants as soon as they are discovered. When they arrive in Jotunheim and achieve unity of mind, they will be able to use the power of giants.”
The platoon commander said it like an excuse, but it wasn’t wrong.
If the 8 egos are overlapped, the schematic of the schema becomes powerful enough to be comparable to an excellent swordsman. By that time, he would not have been able to cope with the strength of a single battalion.
After entering the plains, the group quickly returned to their main unit.
Seeing the party with only one Guroi, the company commander looked at him in disbelief at first, and then suddenly lost his temper.
“What happened! It was Kergoin! I sent five planes to deal with it quickly. I think I sent it to do it this way!”
“sorry.”
The platoon commander repeated the same words.
Anyway, since he was in charge of the platoon, he had nothing to say even if he had 10 mouths.
But Kanya was different.
Shirone is back It also brought a much stronger ally than last time.
This was a good news that could not be compared with the loss of tanks.
“Squadron commander! I have a report for you!”
“What are you! I can’t see you’re looking for a platoon commander! Are you ignoring the chain of command!”
Kuroi Pilot is an infantry squad leader, but reporting directly in front of the platoon leader was a huge disrespect.
But Kanya couldn’t wait.
It was an issue that the chief executive must know about now that the giant’s invasion line was being narrowed through the sound.
“The light of Area 73!”
“what? What nonsense are you talking about?”
Kanya burst into a tantrum and shouted.
“Shirone is here!”

===============================
[418] Second Purgatory (5)
Shirone’s party passed through the battlefield where bullets rained down on them and headed to the command headquarters barracks where the battalion commander was located.
Even if it was the command center, it was right in front of the battlefield, so I couldn’t understand the words without shouting.
It was only after entering the barracks that the noise subsided to some extent.
The company commander, who had already finished his report, was resting in the corner, and Kanya was accompanying him for a smooth conversation from Shirone’s side.
The battalion commander did not take his eyes off the strategic map even after Shirone and his party entered.
“I heard about it.”
He was a cold-looking man with gray hair brushed back, and a thick mustache that looked stubborn.
“Are you a Nephilim?”
Shirone did not deny it.
Regardless of the fact, it seemed that this would be more effective to use the rebels.
The battalion commander seemed uninterested and moved on to the next question.
“I will ask straight forward. Why did you come back?”
Shirone did not understand the question.
“You are like a myth to the rebels. But myths are the most beautiful when they are myths. Some members of the crew consider you an irresponsible fugitive. Why did you, who had already left the battlefield, come here again?”
Shirone had a hunch that one of the people who thought he was a fugitive was the battalion commander.
“There is no great reason. As was the case before, as a single mage, I will fight with all my convictions.”
“Believe… … .”
The battalion commander walked through the window tent and surveyed the battlefield.
“The light you cast on District 73 is now the sun of the 70,000 rebels. I don’t want to put out that light. If you came only because of your beliefs, I’d like to pretend that we never met.”
Shirone realized that the battalion commander would not budge.
What was contained in his cold eyes was not fighting spirit, but only the evil sense of mission that he had chosen the wrong path from the beginning.
“Even if it is a small conviction, the purpose may be the same. I’d like to speak directly with the Commander. Please let me go to the rebel headquarters.”
“refuse.”
There was an unconcealable hostility in the battalion commander’s eyes.
“Okay, let me be honest. The war has already been lost. No, it came to the brink of defeat. If it weren’t for the situation where Heaven’s offensive suddenly stopped, the war would have already ended. It was such an overwhelming gap. Countless crew members lost their lives. The card left to us is negotiations with Heaven. If you’re going to start and put out the fire again, the light in Area 73 will only get in the way.”
“But after all, the war is going on. And Heaven is currently not moving. This could be an opportunity. If you can figure out exactly what the situation is, you have a good chance.”
“Hey, the light of Area 73.”
The battalion commander pressed his face.
“Don’t judge the Mecca with a Norse mindset. It was a rebellion started by the Norse from the beginning. But now? It is only us Mecha people who die. Why did Heaven stop fighting? Who can figure it out?”
“I can figure it out.”
The battalion commander kept his mouth shut. My teeth gnashed in my closed mouth.
“Listen up, sweetheart. Do you think I don’t know what you’re up to? no, i don’t know the truth But I already know that you intend to use us no matter what. People call you Shinhwa, but to me you’re just a seed of disaster. At most, a myth without the ability to defeat a fairy manager. Do you know how fiercely we fought while you were out? On the subject of running away at the most intense time, what and how are you going to change now?”
“I will meet Ikael.”
“pooh… … .”
Wind leaked out of the battalion commander’s mouth.
“Puhahahaha! Fuhahahaha!”
It was really embarrassing.
Archangel Ichael. Meet the person who is located at the top of the heavenly law?
If it had been that easy, hundreds of thousands of his subjects would not have died.
“Now I know for sure. you are not a myth He is a slayer who seduces countless subjects with his three tongues and drives them to death. Company commander! Arrest this guy! Never tell the soldiers.”
Just as the company commander had no choice but to follow orders, the tent in the barracks was pulled down and an adjutant rushed in.
“Captain! This is an emergency. The giants are breaking through the last line of defense.”
“what? why the hell What stupid bastard lured the giant here? Why?”
“It is not confirmed. Since the Kuroi 3 team lost contact, the defense line has been cut off… … .”
The battalion commander hit the tactics table.
“Damn it. Why?”
It is rare for a variable to occur in a giant elimination operation. This is because the reactions of giants without identity are all the same.
But now the last line of deterrence has been breached.
He doesn’t know where the law came from, but he could only think of one thing as he lived today, which was no different from yesterday.
The battalion commander grabbed Shirone by the collar.
“Did you see it? After all, you are the cause of everything. You destroyed Kuroi, leaving a tactical hole in the end. Now I plan to annihilate even our battalion!”
Kanya shouted with readiness to die.
“Commander! That’s a guess! Shirone… … !”
“shut up! Does a pilot who couldn’t even protect his equipment have anything to say in this situation?”
the adjutant pressed.
“Captain! Please give me instructions! If we leave it as it is, we won’t be able to survive for even 30 minutes and will be annihilated!”
The battalion commander mounted a piper hanging on the wall. After putting the Ark in his pocket, he took Cigna and Xd, and as he left the barracks, he glared at Shirone.
“Get out of here quickly. Because I don’t want to see you.”
Kanya shouted.
“Captain! They will also help with power!”
“Did you not hear me? Shirone is the main culprit who changed the giant’s law! Our job now is to fight the enemy, not hide behind those fugitives!”
When the battalion commander left, Kanya had no choice but to follow.
As a soldier, she couldn’t just watch her comrades die.
“Shirone, I’m sorry.”
As she left the barracks, she smiled sadly.
“But it was nice to meet you.”
She didn’t know that it was her own goodbye.
But still, Shirone had not let go of the string of hope.
‘A change of law. They said that the law could be changed by the expression of the will. maybe really… … .’
Gangnan said.
“The situation is worse than expected. Can you really move the rebels like this?”
Sein said.
“There are still many cards to present. Same with Tagis. The problem is command. When I hear about the military community, it seems that the location is being covered up, but if that’s the case, there’s a high chance that you won’t get information from the mainland. I have to do something now.”
Zulu said.
“I think the change in the Law of the Giants is important. I don’t understand why giants, whose only law is to go to Jotunheim, are taking collective action. Can anyone provide an answer to this?”
There was no one.
In Heaven, where the Akashic Records materialize and exist, the law is an artificial system, but in the world where Shirone and the others live, it is simply the principle of the universe.
Just as the flapping of a butterfly’s wings can cause a storm, it was unreasonable to question where the law was changed, since all minor variables are involved.
Gaold suggested his own method.
“First, wipe out all the giants. If you save my life, won’t you let me meet the commander or whatever?”
Shirone raised her hand.
“Leave that to me.”
“no. It’s too dangerous. You have a special mission. Do not think that your life is entirely yours.”
“no. I guess it’s a matter of the law.”
Sein asked.
“Do you have any guesses?”
“yes. But please think of it as an experiment rather than a guess. There are things I must check in heaven.”
* * *
“All attack! Never back down!”
The seven giants grabbed one Kuroi and threw it on the ground, then started stepping on it with small steps.
The c*ckpit is destroyed, and the terrified pilot screams. But in the end, even that cut off after a second.
“Shit! Aaaaaaa!”
The battalion commander who arrived late shot the arc in succession. It was a barrage without aiming or anything.
Still, the giant was right.
Even so, the fact that he was unmoved made the battalion commander miserable.
“Damn it! damn it!”
From the beginning, it was not something that humans could handle.
What is the sake of anecdote? What does it mean to have a fixed lifespan?
Because of the sin against God, man lost the way to eternal life. And now the species was facing extinction.
“Aaaaaaa!”
When the battalion commander slammed the giant’s leg down with the cigna, the giant slowly turned his head, feeling the pain.
The moment I saw the dilated pupil, I got goosebumps.
“Heresy… … Punish it.”
My legs trembled and I couldn’t stand the moaning that leaked through my teeth.
“Huh. Ughhhh.”
As the giant approached, the battalion commander’s face turned into a tearful look.
He had seen countless deaths, but his own death was something new that could not be compared to anything else.
“Heresy… … Punish it.”
“Oh, no. I am heresy… … .”
As the giant’s fist slammed down, the battalion commander let out an inaudible scream and closed his eyes tightly.
kurrrrr… … .
When I slowly opened my eyes to the sound of scratching my neck in a very low voice, a beast I had never seen before stood like a black barrier.
It had silky, black-colored fur, a slim body like a leopard, six legs, a flat face, and protruding canine teeth over a meter long. There were cracks in the ground because of curling up the claws while receiving the giant’s fist.
“What, what is this?”
“What is it? Tier 3 monster cougar.”
Before I knew it, Gaold and the others had arrived.
Zulu took the lead and flicked a finger, and the cougar said, “Gyareung?” I turned around and made a cute noise that didn’t suit his size.
“Go and play.”
Aaaaaaang!
As the cougar kicked off the ground and took flight, the field of view opened wide as if a black curtain had been lifted.
Every time the beast’s claws swung, the giant’s body was cut off.
In terms of athletic ability alone, it was the strength of the Cougar, which is considered the strongest in Tier 3.
The battalion commander, who had been looking at the battlefield as if possessed, slowly turned his head.
“Who are you?”
Gaold pursed his lips and said.
“It is human. Same as you.”
* * *
“Lena! Lena!”
“sister!”
Kanya hugged Lena, who was fighting among the giants, and threw herself.
The sole of the giant’s foot slammed down on the spot where the two were standing, and the body trembled as if it had landed on a rubber sheet.
Lena was terrified by the law, which she had never experienced before. Then, seeing that her kanya was her bare body, he groped her.
“sister! Are you hurt anywhere? What about Kuroi?”
Tears welled up in Kanya before she could even speak.
poor little sister She was born into this world and never did anything good, and it was sad that she had to leave like this.
Lena smiled as if she had sensed something.
“Sister, I am fine.”
Kanya rubbed her cheek against Lena’s cheek.
She’s a smart little sister, so there’s no way she wouldn’t know. Because there were already corpses of comrades everywhere.
The last thing to say has already been decided.
I wanted to say these words before I died, because I was the sister I had been waiting for just as much as she was.
“Lena, Shirone… … .”
“Shirone brother?”
As Lena looked up at the sky and said, Kanya’s eyes shook in shock as she raised her head after her sister.
Shirone spread her golden wings and was flying in the sky.
‘Is this a war in heaven?’
The view of the battlefield from the sky was devastating.
Giants slaughtering humans seemed no different from humans slaughtering ants.
‘But I can finish it. If this works… … .’
Shirone cast Shining Impact. The brightness equal to sunlight blinded everyone.
It was a dark time, so the effect was even greater.
“Gaaaaa!”
“shit! What is it all of a sudden!”
After a while, people regained their sight.
The fear of being blind even to the giant was considerable, so he suddenly turned more frenzied and started screaming.
At that moment, something flashed in the sky, and colorful lights spread across the night sky.
Giants and humans alike raised their heads as rainbow-colored stains fluttered across the plain as the darkness approached.
“I-that… … .”
Shirone, who completed a huge ataraxia above her head, was looking down at everyone with her wings flapping.
The Meccans were stunned.
Now, Shirone’s appearance was exactly the same as the existence that the subjects feared.
“Ughhhh. uhhhhh.”
Hundreds of giants shook the ground, bent their knees, opened their mouths like idiots, and started crying.
Giants also exist in the law.
Ikael’s magic circle had a strong presence in its instincts even when it lost its identity.
“The law… … Coordinator… … .”
As if they thought kneeling was not enough, the giants lowered their bodies with their foreheads on the ground.
The human figure was finally revealed.
However, they also looked back at each other for a moment, then raised their eyes to the sky again.
“The Nephilim… … .”
A word I had forgotten in my head sprang out of the mouths of heretics.
“Sister, Shirone’s brother is here.”
In Kanya’s arms, Lena burst into tears.
Even if someone cursed at her for being a fugitive, even if she regretted being deceived by him and disobeying God, she never doubted Shirone, and this was a miracle for her.
“Yes, Lena. Shirone… … He must have really been a descendant of an angel.”
Shirone returned with golden wings that were more beautiful than those of angels, and a colorful halo, the symbol of an archangel, floated above her head.
From the light of Area 73, to be the light of Heaven.
“Nephilim. Nephilim.”
“O adjuster of the law… … .”
Everyone was kneeling at Shirone’s feet.

Chapter - 419 - In Heaven (1).txt
===============================
[419] In Heaven (1)
Heaven’s sixth thousand jebul. world war.
There is an angel with a face as transparent and beautiful as light.
The pinnacle of intelligence born with a slender body of 2 meters and 30 centimeters and knowing all the principles of the world.
Among the numerous angels, there are only eight archangels, and Kariel, the angel of birth, boasts the most outstanding beauty among them.
But now his face was as drawn as that of a diseased human being.
His eyes were sunken and his expression was nervous.
The benevolent and clear facial lines overflowing with intelligence have often been distorted in recent years.
In fact, he was in a state as if he were sick.
If an angel’s power comes from a clear concept, his current sharpness is only 10% of his usual sharpness.
All of this was the result of the labor he endured to bring one human.
“Kariel, are you really okay?”
Uriel, the angel of destruction, looked at Kariel, whose presence had faded, with concern.
Standing 3 meters tall, the tallest of the archangels, with a solid body and a breastplate thick enough to reach the tip of the chin, a golden halo was rotating as if angry.
“I can still hold on. have to endure Because this is just the beginning.”
In human terms, the amount of fatigue Kariel felt was equivalent to not sleeping for 40 years.
If any creature was hit by this level of fatigue, all of its cells would have already dried up.
But his eyes were still burning with emotion.
Uriel turned his head to where Kariel was looking.
Beneath the galactic mirror that controls the operation of the world, a beautiful woman by human standards was sitting cross-legged.
Adrias Miro.
Could there be a more heinous notion of a heavenly being?
It is the last bastion of humanity that prevents even the incarnation of the Akashic Records, Ankera, from conquering the universe by setting up an impenetrable barrier.
However, even she was defeated by Kariel’s persistence.
“You did it in the end.”
Right before the rebels were annihilated, Anke Ra, who abruptly canceled the war, banned all investigations into humans.
All the angels obeyed the message, but only Kariel did not give up and steadily proceeded with the plan to destroy humans.
What he obtained in this way was the ‘body’ of the maze right in front of him.
“How did you do it? Didn’t I tell you that the labyrinth’s space-time is indestructible?”
A small smile appeared on Kariel’s tired face.
“When I attacked the space-time of the labyrinth with a cloth bomb, Optrus passed through the rift. There was information about the labyrinth’s time-space embedded in its electromagnetic patterns. I analyzed it.”
“But the time-space of the labyrinth immediately healed. Couldn’t you have broken through her dimensional barrier and brought her back?”
“The dimensional barrier is, in fact, insubstantial. The reason why the army of heaven cannot go to the country of the earth is because the protocol is different from this place. It is an independent world without even quantum entanglement.”
Uriel did not try to understand.
Those born for destruction were not obligated to understand what was being destroyed.
“so?”
“I deciphered the protocol with the information I got from Optrus. Then, through quantum superposition, the labyrinth was transported to the Great World War.”
“Hmm, so?”
Kariel realized that Uriel did not understand.
“Simply put, you put your hand in the barrel and pulled until you got the item you wanted. It is no exaggeration to say that the barrel is the size of the entire universe.”
Uriel realized why Kariel was weak.
“So you searched the universe and kidnapped it.”
“what… … That’s right.”
Kariel decided to just move on.
“Hmm.”
Uriel looked at Miro’s face, who was in a state of immersion.
Right before the final war broke out, he had the same youthful face as he had opened the dimensional wall against Heaven’s army alone.
“The human spirit, in a sense, is formidable.”
Currently, her mind, which forms the space-time of the labyrinth, is endlessly being sucked into the dimension of cowardice.
It was a mental state and concept that was incomprehensible to an angel who had everything perfect from birth.
“Hmph, that is the proof of an imperfect existence. Don’t be sentimental about insignificant humans.”
Uriel did not answer.
For him, it is enough to destroy the incomprehensible.
But will Kariel do the same?
Birth is a concept established under the premise that everything is understood.
The fact that Kariel, who handles the art of life, cannot understand humans is perhaps the biggest contradiction in this universe.
“Human beings are very strange creatures. Even now, isn’t one human being blocking all of Heaven’s power?”
Kariel’s expression crumpled.
human. human.
I couldn’t figure out why everyone, starting with Ankera, applied different standards only to humans.
“Nothing like that. I will destroy it.”
Uriel turned around. He didn’t want to offend the twin angels who were born on the same day with different concepts.
“Okay, what are we going to do now? Even if you kill the maze, the maze’s space-time does not disappear. Why did you bring her while torturing her mind to the brink of extinction?”
“Hmph, of course it’s to destroy the labyrinth’s space-time. I’m going to pull the maze out of the fear dimension. If you kill him after coming to his senses, the space-time of the maze will disappear.”
It was the right way, no, the only way.
“But we cannot understand human imperfection. I don’t think there is anyone among the subjects who can understand Miro’s spirit. Because the Nephilim disappeared after the erasure of the Guffin.”
“It is not in heaven, but it is in the kingdom of earth.”
Uriel tilted his head.
Of course, in the kingdom of the earth, there are those who spontaneously awaken as Nephilim.
However, since the space-time of the maze was blocking it, it was impossible to bring someone from there.
“Are you going to search the entire universe again? Then it may completely disappear.”
“You don’t have to. I don’t even have the strength left.”
Kariel flew up to the pillar-shaped central system and accessed the Akashic Records.
Yuriel, who flew after her, looked at the screen from behind Kariel.
“I was looking through the Akashic Records and found something interesting.”
As Kariel stepped aside, a human’s name appeared on the screen.
While reading the explanation below, Yuriel nodded.
“Certainly, interesting.”
Coincidentally, he was the one who understood the human spirit the best.
No, it was right to see it changed to its current state because it understands the human mind the best.
“I will summon Lee to the Great World War.”
When Kariel opened her hand, a celestial body flashed and a code of laws was born on the palm.
The law code containing the principles of the universe was a high-strength metal hard cover, and the pages made of light began to turn.
As the central computing system was fully operational, bluish electricity flowed along the floor like waves and gathered in the arched mechanism.
Uriel looked at that scene for a while, then turned his head back to the screen of the central processing unit.
‘It’s a grave robber… … .’
The name of someone who only existed as a concept was blinking.
Morrigan Arius
* * *
Rebel 1st Command.
Shirone’s party received enthusiastic cheers from the rebels.
The heroic story of Shirone, who subjugated hundreds of giants with the power of an archangel, quickly spread through drones, and has already become a new myth of the rebels.
In the midst of the huge white noise, Shirone’s face was saddened.
It was strange that the number 1 was attached to the headquarters, but the size of the rebel base, which was much larger than expected, dispelled any doubts.
Dozens of buildings presumed to be munitions warehouses surrounded the site, and a huge building over 30 meters in height stood tall in the forest.
‘It’s amazing power. If they move… … .’
Gaold thought differently.
‘Not even the seeds will be eaten.’
Of course, the power of the headquarters was formidable.
However, there was no doubt in the words of the battalion commander that they were on the brink of annihilation.
It’s not a matter of power asymmetry.
From the beginning, beings in heaven were something different from humans.
If thousands of ants bite humans, they will die, but just as humans would not be treated like that in the first place, so were the angels.
“uh? there is Shirone Hey Shirone! It’s me, me!”
A familiar face popped out of the middle of the procession.
It was Clove and Gadlock who guided Shirone and her friends to Nord’s shelter a year ago in Heaven.
The memory of Clove’s ignoring Amy still lingers, but it was nice to find a familiar face in a moment like this.
But Shirone couldn’t bear to go there. It was because the huge crowd of people who had heard Clove’s words were all about to jump out.
“Wow! It was real! The real Shirone is here!”
Clove and Gardlock were buried in the crowd and were not even visible.
It was a phenomenon that occurred because very few people outside of District 73 knew Shirone’s face.
Shirone widened the distance with a cold expression.
It was a situation where people could get hurt if they got closer.
Watching Shirone walk away, Clove teared her hair and spat out words of lamentation.
“Oh, I never thought that kid would become such an important person. If she had known it would be like this, she would have gotten to know her in advance.”
Gadlock thumped the disciple’s head.
“Is that a problem now? It’s a decision whether or not to be annihilated by the angels.”
Clove said with a sad expression.
“But Master said so too, when Shirone comes, we will be treated well here too.”
Gadlock was speechless.
Shirone is back And that too at the perfect timing.
The suspension of Heaven’s attack was certainly a boon to the rebels, but that alone could not bridge the gap between Mecca and the Norse, which had deepened as they lost a series of battles.
The headquarters, which failed to reach a consensus, was finally separated into the 1st and 2nd headquarters, and there was no battle, but the defeat was already deep.
At the point where everyone was waiting for self-destruction, the light of Area 73 began to shine on them again.
‘Why now? Did he come back knowing?’
A series of events connected by an invisible link made it impossible to dismiss Shirone’s return as a mere miracle.
“Hehe, it’s so nice to walk with you like this.”
Meanwhile, Lena, who was holding Shirone’s arm, didn’t leave her side for a moment as she went to the command center.
Then Fleur, who was watching the back of Shirone with her back stiff, clicked her tongue and said.
“What is that doing? Did you come to heaven to fall in love?”
Gaold didn’t care.
“Hey, leave it alone. Something like that will help the parade.”
A miracle called Shirone came to the rebels who were on the brink of annihilation, so it would have been okay to put in a little production.
However, Kanya was embarrassed by her sister’s rudeness.
Unbearable, she approached Lena and whispered in her ear.
“What are you doing? come off quickly Don’t you know what Shirone means to the rebels? What if people misunderstand?”
“What misunderstanding? Shirone oppa and we aren’t even close. We met for the first time in a year, can’t you even cross your arms?”
Lena turned to Shirone and said.
“Brother and sister, please have them cross their arms next to you.”
Shirone couldn’t find words to answer.
My heart is beating even now, but how could I go on the road with two women on my arms?
Kanya’s face turned red like a blush.
“You, what do you mean by that? Why am I arm in arm with Shirone?”
“Oh, yes. My sister is too weak for this. We have to look like we’re close with Shirone brother so we can work at headquarters. My sister’s Kuroi was also damaged. I have to get a new Kuroi here to become a pilot again.”
Kanya drank honey and became mute.
Although he is young, he thinks of his younger brother more carefully.
No, should I call it clever in this case?
Shirone reassured her.
“Canya, don’t worry too much. Because I destroyed Kuroi. I’ll be sure to tell you when I see the Commander.”
Smiling at Shirone, Kanya opened her eyes again and looked back at Lena.
‘Aww, that fox… … .’
Rena wrapped her arms around Shirone, whether or not she knew her sister’s feelings, and only smiled happily.

[420] In Heaven (2)
When I entered the command center building and the iron door closed, the cheers outside were blocked as if I had woken up from a dream.
The lights on the ceiling of the corridor were kept to a minimum brightness, and soldiers stood guard at precise intervals along the way.
Armed with the 1st level of the Mecha combat system, they never looked back at Shirone’s party. However, the intensity of his gaze was terrifying enough to pierce through a wall.
‘They are all elite soldiers.’
The Mechas do not have superhuman bodies or magical abilities, but they have technical skills to compensate for both.
Since war is all about winning anyway, it was better not to think that their own power would be weak just because they were weak.
The colonel guided Shirone and the others to the underground bunker.
The bunker’s security system was in no way inferior to the association’s technology, and when the iron door was opened, numerous mechanical devices were operating.
While the technicians were busy moving their hands while watching the monitors, a man in a commander’s cape watched their work with his hands behind his back.
“Commander, Shirone has been brought to you.”
At the colonel’s words, the commander turned around.
It was a man in his late 20s with a long scar running down the side of his ear from his temple.
Her thin lips were stubbornly closed, and the eyes behind her glasses showed coolness and passion.
Crude, the first commander of the rebels.
As Kanya had told me, he was a young man.
Age doesn’t matter much in a war, especially if it’s a battle with a lot of defeat.
What the soldiers wanted was a commander who had the courage to rush towards death first and the tactical skills to save as many people as possible.
Crude was a man who met exactly that condition.
He is a genius pilot who knows everything about the maintenance, driving, and operation of the Titan belonging to the 3rd level mecha combat system, and a mecha war hero with a history of defeating Mara.
“Are you Shirone?”
Crud held out his hand to Shirone.
“nice to meet. This is Krude, the first commander of the rebels.”
“This is Shirone.”
Crude looked carefully at Shirone and the others.
Having numerous battle experiences, he recognized the strength of the party at a glance, but his dignified eyes did not waver.
But when I saw Fleur, my eyes lingered for a moment, going back to being a twenty-eight-year-old engineer who had struggled with machines all his life.
A slim, straight-style woman with blue hair braided down to her waist.
What I particularly liked was her eyes. Among her group, she was the only one with full strength.
Like a heroine entering the battlefield for the first time.
But that was it.
Crude also knew the anecdote of Shirone, the light of District 73, but the war he actually experienced was too realistic to rely on myths.
“Go to a quiet place.”
Crude guided everyone to the strategy meeting room deep inside the bunker.
Of course, tea was not served, and as soon as we sat down, we got down to business.
“I heard you wanted to meet me?”
Sein sat down at the negotiating table as the representative.
“We will attack Heaven. We ask for the cooperation of the rebel command.”
“refuse.”
Crude’s answer was immediate.
“I heard that there was a conflict with the battalion commander. Of course, a broken-hearted soldier is useless on our side, but if you think about it coolly, there is no chance of going to war right away. It is nothing more than a delusion that you can attack heaven for subduing a giant who has lost his identity.”
Sein meekly nodded.
I was worried when I saw the battalion commander soaked in defeat, but the commander was different.
“That means we haven’t given up on the war.”
“There is always room for compromise, whether it be a truce or not. Because I can’t kill those who believe in me and follow me. But I don’t think Heaven will see us as an object of compromise. If you have to fight anyway, you have to win to survive.”
“What if we had a strategy to win?”
“Heh, bullshit.”
Hundreds of thousands of rebels, including the existing cults and subjects from Heaven, fought against Heaven, but only a handful of cases were recorded with remarkable achievements.
It is the union of Nor and Mecca that they have not been able to capture even the triangular Mara, let alone a normal angel. What could be done with just 10 humans added?
“I will paralyze the Aegis system with the Targis. Then you can infiltrate heaven and wage guerrilla warfare.”
Aegis, the core air defense system of Heaven, is an impregnable shield capable of attacking 7,000 targets simultaneously by setting the order of interception through two hundred search methods.
If they were able to break through and enter without blood, the rebels would have a glimmer of hope.
“Hehehehe.”
Crude covered her face and let out her lungs.
“I don’t know where you heard the word Tagis, but it is one of the technologies that have already been lost in Mecca.”
Crude lowered his hand and was no longer smiling.
“Think common sense. The angels can’t just leave the technology that paralyzes Heaven’s interception system. We need access to the Akashic Records to bring the technology back to life. But in order to do that, we have to break through the Aegis system first. Do you understand now? The order has been changed, you idiot.”
Sain leaned back on the chair back and crossed his legs.
“if… … What if I said I had that skill?”
“what?”
Crude’s face went blank.
“What nonsense is that?”
“There is no law that technology that is lost in heaven is not the same in the land kingdom. For 20 years, I wandered the world researching everything about ancient weapons. And now, I have blueprints for the perfectly restored Targis in my head. How is it, is your head spinning now?”
Crude’s eyes started to get confused.
“If it’s false… … .”
“We can restore it right now. There is no oblivion in my head. You’re also an engineer anyway, so you’ll be able to understand it enough by looking at the blueprints.”
‘I see. So on the black line… … .’
Shirone looked at Sein differently.
Ancient weapons are top secret regardless of the kingdom.
The act of accessing information alone was a dangerous thing that would be punished by death, only to save the labyrinth.
“Hmm… … .”
Crud was also confused now.
who the heck are these? Why do you want to do something that even hundreds of thousands of rebels couldn’t do?
‘No, what’s important is whether or not it’s successful.’
Even if you paralyze Aegis and enter heaven, angels and maras, giants and fairies are waiting for you.
Defeating them and infiltrating Arabot, where Ankera is located, was the equivalent of carrying gunpowder and jumping into the fire.
‘You can jump in though. There’s even a 1 percent chance.’
is this a miracle? Or is it the last struggle of the brightest burning candle right before it goes out?
“Three… … There are conditions.”
There were more conditions than expected, but Sein rather felt trust. This is because it is proof that Crude is dealing with the current plan realistically.
“Listen first.”
Crud said while pointing his finger.
“First, use the light of Area 73, Shirone, to appease the 2nd HQ. Even if you infiltrate Heaven, if Mecca and Norr don’t unite, you’ll hit a rock with an egg anyway.”
“I guess so. next?”
“Second, even if there are blueprints, large Targis that affect the whole of Heaven cannot be built here. We need to rent a factory on the mainland, so get their permission and come.”
Sein recalled the memory of the first time he met the rebels.
“Is it a military community?”
“okay. To be precise, it is a defense industry called ‘Night Maeng’. They are a new power that has grown rapidly by taking advantage of the civil war in Heaven, and they have monopolized weapon production by taking over all the military complexes. They are detestable to the rebels. However, without borrowing their strength, an all-out war with Heaven is impossible.”
“good. What is the final condition?”
Crud was initially hesitant to make the offer.
I don’t know how great Shirone and the others were, but it wasn’t something a single team could do.
“You’ll probably need a black elixir to make the tagis.”
“Black Elixir?”
“Most lifeforms in Heaven receive the life stream flowing on the planet into their bodies and create elixirs. There are five types. Red, green, yellow, white, and finally black.”
“Does it have to be black? As far as I know, the elixir has a technique to bypass it depending on the mixing and ratio of the ingredients, right?”
“Elixirs have unique effects for each type. Red is heat, green is a biochemical element, yellow is an energy property change, and white is involved in an atmospheric element. The rocks of heaven are so durable that they do not weather even after tens of thousands of years. That’s why you need an elixir that contains the power of the planet.”
Crud pointed towards the warehouse.
“For example, it takes 8,000 red elixirs to cast the metal that goes into one Guroi, but if you mix white elixirs, the efficiency of the thermal reaction is much higher. Mixing white and yellow can also generate electricity. Like this, the elixir is the means to achieve everything in this world.”
Fleur asked.
“Then what does the black elixir do?”
Crud looked at Fleur’s face for a moment, then turned his gaze to Sein and replied.
“Black Elixir, simply put, governs time.”
“hour? Is it some kind of magic?”
“no. To be precise, it reverses or accelerates an irreversible phenomenon. If you use the black elixir on a mixture of ink and water, the ink and water will not separate again. In case of burns, black and green elixirs can also be used to repair cellular damage.”
“I can’t… … .”
Shirone couldn’t believe it.
It was a phenomenon of ignoring the chemistry laws he had learned in school so far.
Zulu asked.
“What about palpation?”
“It shortens the reaction rate. Green Elixir is the basic element that makes up living things, and Black Elixir can be mixed with it to cause mutations. I heard that in some cases, evolutionary products come out thousands of years later.”
Gaold said.
“It’s a philosopher’s stone.”
I’ve heard of Shirone too.
It’s not a word commonly used in magic, but it’s a substance that alchemists call a dream ingredient.
There is a fantasy product in heaven that can turn mere iron into gold or cure an incurable disease.
‘no way… … then?’
There was one incident that came to Shirone’s mind.
The other day, when Kanya’s mother became the subject of an anecdote, the large glass ball was filled with black liquid.
A cruel technique that melts a human into a statue of a giant and casts the giant out of it like a mould.
The reason why it felt more cruel was because it was a strange phenomenon that his head could not understand at all.
A black liquid that dissolves and reconstitutes living things.
If that was possible in this world, a black elixir that ignores chemical reactions would surely be involved.
Sain grasped Crud’s intentions.
“Using the Philosopher’s Stone to shorten the production process of Tagis, are you talking about that?”
“That’s it. Targis can be crafted with existing elixirs. But just melting rocks to extract and melt metals will eat up all your time. equipment is provided. Whatever it is, melt it down with black elixir and process the metal needed for Targis. These are my three conditions.”
Armin asked.
“What is the probability if you collect it by hunting?”
Crud shook his head.
“0 percent. Black Elixir is not created in the body of a living being. It is an element that can only be obtained from beings who have transcended the flow of time, that is, from the dead.”
If collecting planetary energy is different depending on the propensity of the creature, it was quite understandable given the non-ideality of the Philosopher’s Stone.
“Undead creatures live in the erosion valley northwest of the mainland. But even if I catch a thousand, I’m afraid there will be one. In other words, it is not even a 0.1 percent chance.”
said Gaold indifferently.
“Then what are we to do?”
“There is one. A place where you can get the Black Elixir with a 30%, no, 50% chance.”
Sein asked.
“Where is it?”
Crude hesitated here again.
However, realizing that he couldn’t stop talking, he widened his eyes and opened his mouth.
“The world of the dead, Niflheim.”

[421] In Heaven (3)
The desperate agony of the Great World War broke out.
Arius, fired from the electricity, flew 10 meters and rolled on the floor.
Apoptosis, the magic that dives into his thoughts, imprisons him in the concept of eternity, where time does not exist.
It was a kind of mental death, and the shock of actually returning was nothing compared to the horror of a newborn fetus.
“Ouch! Aaaagh!”
Arius couldn’t stop screaming.
Everything was confusing and unsettling.
Only the afterimages left vaguely in my memory gave me a vague idea of who he was.
At the borders of oblivion, a thread of intellect flowed in and connected with memory.
The screams died down only after he recalled the scene where he cast magic while avoiding Walker’s sword at the Kazra Palace.
‘Damn it, I can’t even do this.’
Arius, who stood up while wiping the sludge from under his chin, was suspicious of the unfamiliar sight.
“here is… … ?”
The person who pulled me out of apoptosis would be someone from the 7 Madou Girls, and if so, it should be their own hideout that no one knows, but the scenery they saw was completely different.
All over the light purple iron color, strange mechanical devices were operating with light.
“Are you a grave robber?”
Arius looked back with a displeased expression.
However, he soon had to raise his head, and the iris in his pupils narrowed in response to his surprise.
The light body above the head, huge wings of light many times larger than the body.
was an angel
‘Why an angel… … ?’
The moment the question was about to rise to the top of his head, he quickly suppressed it with the battery of the flicker magic.
You have to run away.
The thought was next.
Flash! And when his body turned into light, Uriel’s hand flew in faster than a moment.
“Keugh!”
Arius, who was caught by the neck, struggled at a height of 3 meters.
It wasn’t that my throat was strangled, it felt like my neck bones were being grabbed.
“Sah, live… … !”
As Uriel struck down Arius, he fell to the ground, straightening his back like a bow and moaning in pain.
Then, struggling to get down on one knee, he looked up at the angels.
“Damn, what the hell are you all about?”
“I am Uriel, the angel of destruction.”
“Yu, Uriel?”
One of only 8 archangels in heaven.
Arius’ gaze quickly scanned the surroundings.
After grasping the objects, devices, and even the Milky Way, he realized that it was a great world war.
‘Then the one next to me is Kariel… … .’
If there were two archangels, it had to be considered that there was no possibility that even Arius of the 7 Magicians could leave this place alive on his own.
“There is something I want to show you.”
Kariel, who floated Arius in the air, flew in front of the Milky Way and threw him again.
“Keugh!”
Falling from the stomach, he caught his breath, then raised his head with difficulty realizing that there was someone in front of him.
A woman was sitting cross-legged.
“human?”
said Uriel.
“It’s Adrias Miro.”
Arius’ eyes widened in shock.
“Mi, maze? Who is this woman?”
Miro is an unforgettable name for scale wizards.
However, it was the first time seeing the face of even the grave robber Arius.
It looks like this.
She was a common girl, a girl you could see anywhere in the world. It’s enough to make you look away for a moment if you run into them while passing by.
However, the modifiers attached to her were all superlatives, such as the best, last, final, and strongest.
That’s why Arius had no choice but to look at the face of the girl with weak eyes closed as if possessed.
It’s beautiful, just by existing.
Arius, who hastily regained consciousness, analyzed the situation based on the existing information.
Archangel, Great World War, Labyrinth.
‘Damn it. Did I come this far after all?’
The fact that Miro is in heaven can also be interpreted as meaning that the final war is imminent.
‘What the hell is going on? Did you know in the original world?’
I wanted to talk to Miro, but she showed no signs of waking up.
Arius looked back at Kariel and asked.
“Are you asleep?”
“no. Miro enters the dimension of cowardice. You can put her back the way she was.”
‘It’s cowardly… … .’
Arius’ face contorted.
‘shit! It’s a good experience.’
Now I’m just starting to get some strands.
Miro cannot be killed as long as he is in the state of samadhi. Also, that was the reason why he called himself, a grave robber, to this place.
“Destroy the fear of the labyrinth.”
Arius snorted.
When he was captured by Uriel, he instinctively asked for help, but death was not a priority for him who regained his intelligence.
If the labyrinth is pulled out of the cowardice, the space-time of the labyrinth will be destroyed, and what remains is the destruction of mankind.
‘It doesn’t really matter, but I don’t like it when they go their way.’
Still, I had no intention of giving up.
It is none other than exploring the spirit of one of the greatest wizards in human history.
I wanted to know, what the hell was going on in this woman’s head.
What you like, what you don’t like, what you’re ashamed of, and what secrets you need to take to the grave.
“Destroy Samadhigyeong?”
Arius frowned and said.
“Are you kidding me?”
“If you don’t, you die.”
“You don’t think that’s a threat, do you? This woman is mankind’s strongest scale wizard. She will only be crushed by the Egoist no matter who dives, not me.”
“Then I have no choice but to die.”
When Kariel held out his hand, Arius raised both hands as if to calm down.
“wait. It doesn’t mean I won’t do it. It just means you have to find a way around it.”
“bypass? You mean the mind?”
“Anyway, if you dive right now, you will be swept away by the samadhi. But what about Drimo? I will collect the spirit of the maze from Dremo, where any thoughts flow. It’s about finding keywords that are strong enough to break the samadhi.”
“keyword?”
“Every human being has trauma. A trauma that takes your breath away the moment you think about it. We make a powerful net out of them and cast them into the abyss. Then pull? The big fish called maze will be caught.”
Kariel stared at Arius, who was talking excitedly.
Are you insane? To be so zealous in destroying humanity.
‘I can’t understand at all, the seeds called humans.’
Arius made a condition.
“However, Drimo is a multi-dimensional structure, so it is not a place where you can investigate freely. So give me some information. Don’t you guys know?”
“Hmm.”
Suddenly, Kariel’s planetary body expanded into a halo.
While Arius’ face turned pale, a black orb squeezed through space and was born.
“Come out, Brahma.”
“Kiiiii!”
The hooked nose protruded first, followed by the red-skinned face.
The eyes were slit and the teeth irregularly aligned.
There were three luminous triangles floating on the front of the forehead, and the brain was connected beyond the top of the head. Unlike humans with brain water inside the skull, it flowed down like hair and reached the tip of the toes of a short stature.
Kariel’s family, the triangular Mara Brahma.
In some parts of the human world, he was a being called the god of creation.
“Meet the humble Brahma, Archangel Kariel.”
“Follow that human to Drimo. Cooperate with whatever he may be investigating.”
Arius had an absurd expression.
‘Damn it, Brahma?’
As a wizard, it was shocking that the god of intelligence in mythology looked like that.
But he quickly regained his cool.
This is your chance.
If he borrowed the knowledge of the triangular Mara, he would be able to access the depths of Drimo that humanity has not reached.
‘Hehehe, the magic god is smiling at me.’
Arius approached the maze.
I will dig up everything about her.
And when I come back, I will be the god of the world.
“Let’s go. Heaven seems to be quite busy too.”
Brahma stretched out a strand of brain water and pushed it through the labyrinth’s mouth into the brain.
As the area of the brain responsible for Drimo was activated, a small space-time tunnel appeared in front of his eyes.
Arius flung himself without delay, followed by Brahma.
“Whoa.”
Kariel sat down only after the space-time tunnel closed.
It was no exaggeration to say that summoning the triangular Mara was squeezing out all remaining power.
“Are you okay?”
“Power comes back after time. If only the labyrinth wakes up, humans are doomed. There will be a right of origin at the Archangel Council as well.”
“You may not succeed. According to the kinship law, even Brahma is not in a normal state.”
The sum of the abilities of the three Maras commanded by the angels can never exceed the abilities of the angels.
This is according to the reason that an acquired concept cannot appear without an antecedent concept.
This is the family law.
As long as Kariel’s presence was weakened, even Brahma, the triangular mara, could not exert his full power.
“doesn’t care. After all, Brahma was born as an imitation of my intellect. It can make a judgment in one second that 10,000 prudent humans made through compromise. It will take some time, but he’ll be able to pull it off.”
It will take time. But what can you do?
If that’s the last time left for mankind anyway.
* * *
The strategy conference room was seized with silence.
Niflheim.
It is a place where even the border people of the mainland are forbidden to approach, and the only beings inhabiting it are evil specters who were once feared by humans.
Crud gave realistic advice this time as well.
“Let me be clear, it is a very dangerous place. Considering the value of the Black Elixir, many people deserve to take on the challenge, but even that has been abandoned thousands of years ago. One reason. Because if you go, you will surely die. So choose well.”
Sein asked.
“Do you see we have a choice? in this situation?”
“Even if we don’t go to Niflheim, we can still maintain our alliance. Opportunities don’t just exist. But it means that these three conditions must be met if the 1st Command goes to all-out war.”
Taking the safe route takes a long time. Conversely, it was too risky to take the fast route.
“Gaold, what are you going to do?”
Sein handed over the judgment to the commander.
But in reality, it was just a polite question. With no way to know Miro’s life or death, he had only one choice.
“I’m going to Niflheim.”
“Hmm.”
Crude’s sigh continued for a long time.
“I think highly of you. That’s why you want to dry it. It is also a good idea to use the light of Area 73 to increase the size of the rebels. why are you in a hurry? Any special reason?”
Impatience breeds mistakes.
Gaold also knew that fact, so he desperately maintained his composure.
But looking at it objectively, time was not leisurely.
It would be impossible to kill a maze in heaven in heaven, but neither were those who would do such a thing without any countermeasures.
“I don’t know. I’ll meet the three conditions as quickly as possible. So, are there any complaints?”
“of course. But, if possible.”
Crude was skeptical until the end.
“From now on, we divide the team. I, Gangnan, and Zulu enter Niflheim.”
Sein asked.
“Then what about the rest?”
“Armin, Siena, Ethella, and Kuan are in charge of the munitions community. Shirone and Fleur convince 2nd Command. For now, this is the only way.”
Even in Sein’s opinion, the number of people was divided as much as possible considering the difficulty of the mission.
“Then I will stay here and strategize. In addition, I have to figure out about planetary movements.”
In order for God’s Punishment to properly stick to Arabot, precise forecasts of the landing point are required. To do so, what had to be preceded was an understanding of planetary motion.
“Are you sure you want to go, to Niflheim?”
Crude couldn’t understand Shirone and the others.
Even if 10 people rush in, no, even if you ask for support from the rebels, you will split the team.
“Are you guys insane?”
Gaold said as he left.
“no.”

Chapter - 422 - Second Command (1).txt
===============================
[422] Second Command (1)
Shirone headed to 2nd HQ with Fleur.
Clove and Gardlock were the guides, and various information was heard while riding on the spot of light to narrow the distance.
“According to research, the ‘looking down’ of the angels is not a departure from the gaze of the observer, but a cannibalistic appearance that draws the desired place in front of the eyes. It’s like opening a drawer in your room and looking through it. Then how did the rebels avoid looking down?”
Guardlock’s words were translated through a drone from headquarters.
The drones produced in heaven do not have the language of the land country, but the ‘Night Blindness’ thing has even been programmed with the language of numerous border people.
“Hmm, put a lock on the drawer?”
Gadlock nodded at Fleur’s words.
“That’s the Mecca way. The self-developed magnetic field disrupts the landscape and makes it impossible to focus.”
Shirone said.
“So the second one is that you make a lot of drawers?”
“answer. Currently, the 2nd Command, which we are heading to, is being operated as a scattered point organization. It’s a classic stealth strategy, but the risk is much less.”
Fleur asked.
“Which place is it? 2nd Command.”
“I’ve never been to headquarters either. After serving in the 13th Battalion, I was transferred to the 1st Command. However, compared to Mecha, which values leadership, Norr prioritizes individual abilities. I have the idea that a person with power should be the commander.”
Shirone said.
“Then the commander must be a very strong person.”
“I heard that. It’s a woman named Ray Sis, and according to her rumors, she has a whopping 32 percent Spirit Force.”
Spirit Force is an indicator of affinity for Jung, and it is a mental state that is much closer to the essence than Spirit Zone.
Fleur asked.
“How great is 32 percent? If it reaches 100 percent, will you be able to use it freely?”
“That’s a lot. Because it’s friendly anyway. Is 32 percent enough to provide drinking water for 100 people with just one drop? Usually Norr’s affinity is only 7-8%. Even if there is only a 1% difference, the magical power increases exponentially.”
Shirone visualized the image of the commander of the 2nd headquarters, albeit vaguely.
“Anyway, I’m in favor of this journey. Mecha is strong against giants, but weak against fairies. On the other hand, Norse are strong against fairies. Union is essential to survival.”
While talking like that, Shirone and the others arrived at the spot of light.
Particles of light were floating on top of the transparent stream that shimmered like diamonds.
Guard Rock pushed through the water and entered the city. He punched the spot and prepared the magic of light Elijah.
Flew asked as he watched the light seep through his fists.
“Do we have to go further from here? It’s already the third.”
“This is the end.”
If they were attacked on the way to this place, the information could be leaked, so these words were saved.
Fleur nodded and approached Shirone.
It’s easier on the inside than when there were seniors like Giraseong, but now she had to protect Shirone completely.
As I left the bunker after negotiating with Crude last night, I remembered the story I heard from Gaold.
“Flu.”
“Yes, president of the Association.”
Gaold, who sang the flue, glanced at Shirone and then said:
“I am concerned. Other teams have a mix of veterans, but you and Shirone are different.”
Flew readily admitted.
Of course, he knew that what Gaold was worried about was not the safety of Shirone and Fleur, but the failure of the project.
“I am fully aware. I will risk my life so as not to become an annoyance to my seniors.”
“One of a kind, if things go wrong… … .”
Gaold stopped talking.
It was truly a wonder to Flew.
The mere fact that he hesitated, likened to a machine with a broken brake, was already rewarded.
Flew said with a soft smile.
“Do not worry. If there’s one life that needs to be lost on this project, I know it’s me. As a supporter, no matter what happens, I will definitely bring Shirone back to life.”
Shirone, who joined the team as a Terminator, is the task force’s master key to survive until the end, even if most of the team members die.
It was embarrassing as a wizard to weigh the life of a supporter and a factor with such a heavy mission.
Gaold looked at Fleur in silence for a moment. Then he turned around, viciously tearing the corner of his mouth.
“Cheuk, trust me.”
The last words penetrated deep into Flew’s heart.
She gazed at Gaold’s broad back with a blank expression, and raised a salute with a smile on her face.
‘It’s okay to die. I’m on the best team.’
“excuse me… … .”
At that time, Crude, who had been watching the two of them from afar, walked away clearing his throat.
Even in wartime, he carefully expressed his emotions, which is the principle that human beings should live like human beings.
“If there is anything uncomfortable… … .”
“doesn’t exist.”
Flew, as if he had never done that, withdrew his smile and turned away with a cold expression.
Shirone was playing with the killifish with her feet.
He was 19 years old, which would be perfect if he wasn’t on a mission in a place like this.
I will do my best to protect Shirone.
However, it is also true that words such as the best in practice have no meaning.
It was only important to complete the goal by any means and methods, and to do so, Shirone also needed determination.
“Listen. Since you’ve come this far, you’re a wizard too. He hasn’t graduated yet, so he’s an unofficial wizard.”
Shirone looked at Fleur in bewilderment.
“So from now on I will treat you as a pro. It means that you should not be swayed by emotions and be faithful to your mission. I’m not asking you to do anything unreasonable. In fact, I can’t even tell what’s absurd. Because that’s what war is. If there is confusion, just stick to your mission.”
There is no way you wouldn’t know that it was Shirone.
Seniors like the sky would be willing to give their lives to protect him who doesn’t even have a magician’s license.
What’s most nerve-wracking is knowing that, but having to drive them to death without hesitation.
‘I must live. It’s such a mission.’
Shirone nodded with a determined expression.
“yes. Do not worry.”
No one wants to take on a job they don’t like.
If you can’t do it yourself, someone else will eventually have to do it for you.
Shirone made up her mind. no, i wished
Whatever the situation, please do not hesitate.
“depart.”
Elijah’s gigantic flash shot up into the sky.
* * *
The forest landscape shimmered as the world was bathed in warm light.
After the light faded, the landscape changed from a valley with a stream to the middle of a forest with a dense forest.
Flew asked, looking around.
“Is this headquarters?”
“no. Command’s gatekeeper will lead us. Maybe we should go a lot further here.”
It was a measure to avoid being followed. I could see how thoroughly they were hiding.
Gadlock put his finger in his mouth and whistled.
As the sound magic ferry was cast, sounds like the chirping of hundreds of birds soared into the forest’s sky.
After a while, a man appeared from behind a tree.
“Where are you from? Haven’t you received a report today?”
He was a man with a cold impression.
He has blue hair, raised eyebrows, and shaved the left side of his head. The right side of her hair, down to her shoulder, was covering one of her eyes.
Gadlock pointed at Shirone and said.
“I am from First Command. You must have heard the rumors, this boy here… … .”
“Ah, that’s right.”
The man raised his hand and cast a spell.
Forest Magic Oprica.
The trees in the back swayed, and numerous vines flew at Shirone and the others, showing a rapid growth rate.
“Keugh!”
Clove and Gardlock, terrified, lost their balance and landed on their butts, while Shirone and Fleur did not move.
The flying trajectory was not aimed at him.
Perhaps, if he had kept his cool a little longer, anyone would have figured it out.
The vines were planted in the ground, and then grew in an arch.
In an instant, Shirone and the others were imprisoned in a prison entwined with arch-patterned trees.
‘This is ancient plant magic.’
According to the afterimage from when he competed with Bossun in Kazura, even a certified 4th grade wizard could not produce such a rapid growth effect.
I didn’t think that man was stronger than Bossun, but it seemed that there was definitely an advantage of ancient magic using Jung’s affinity.
‘It won’t be easy anyway.’
It bothered me that from the very beginning, there had been very little proper negotiations for a group that had staged armed demonstrations.
The gatekeeper cast Oprica anew and drew another twig and aimed it at the party.
“What business do those who betrayed Norr have to us?”
Clove shouted, grabbing hold of the prison.
“What is this? Do you know who this person is? The light of Area 73, Shirone!”
The more hostile the relationship, the more active the espionage warfare.
The gatekeeper also knew that Shirone had returned.
“so?”
“So what? aren’t you going to war? You don’t know how much the morale of the rebels increases when Shirone is around, so you ask?”
A spear-sharp branch pierced a crack in the cell and stopped in front of Clove’s nose.
“Kuk!”
Clove hurriedly backed away and shot his back at the prison on the other side.
Oprica is a magic that cannot be cast without an affinity exceeding 10%.
With only 7% affinity, he could not resist the man’s prestige.
“What about the light in Area 73? When were you criticizing and blaming Nord, when did you say let’s come and fight together? We don’t need the might of the Mechas. How can you compete with angels with those who are only mechanical?”
“How do you know that?”
Shirone said.
“We are here to meet your captain, not you. I don’t think you have the right to decide something with the fate of the entire Norse at stake.”
The man turned his gaze to Shirone.
I have heard the story of Shirone’s saga, but the Norse, who have an absolute standard of power, are not simply deceived by myths.
If he thought that he would be able to work here as long as he defeated the fairy manager, Girin Lee, then the light in District 73 was either a fairly weak guy or a kid drunk on his own power.
“Maybe. But as a gatekeeper, I have the authority. Whether it’s the Nephilim or the Light of District 73, strength is what matters in war. I don’t know how it was in Mecca, but the Norse doesn’t even snort when he whines in a wooden prison.”
“okay?”
Shirone sighed and put her palm on the prison cell.
As the light began to focus on his hand, the gatekeeper hurriedly backed away.
According to what I’ve heard, Shirone can freely use light regardless of affinity, and can destroy things with it.
“joy! Let’s see… … !”
The gatekeeper is also a master of ancient magic who has been given the crucial task of protecting the rebel headquarters.
Grabbing all the vegetation around him, he twisted the vines into sharp spears and prepared to strike back.
‘what?’
But the situation to counterattack did not come.
The light gathered in Shirone’s hands gradually turned dark, and the vines began to twist grotesquely.
Amgu.
The gatekeeper had no choice but to let go of his hands and stare blankly at the sight of the thick trees twisting.
Crunchy! Sigh!
With a sound like bones being crushed, the intertwined hemispherical prison was torn from the ground.
Deed Deed Dede Deuk!
Eventually, it twisted toward the hole in the space and began to be sucked in.
The tree struggled from root to root, like a glutton swallowing a living creature whole, and yet it was eventually forcibly consumed and disappeared without a trace.
Clove and Gardlock’s faces turned pale.
The other day, when Shirone broke a rock with his light, he wasn’t quite as surprised.
“Um, what kind of magic is that, Master?”
“… … .”
There was no way to know that it was Gadlock. Perhaps the gatekeeper is the same.
All the Norse were staring at Shirone in a state of fascination.

Chapter - 423 - Second Command (2).txt
===============================
[423] Second Command (2)
“Oh, this can’t be… … .”
The gatekeeper was speechless.
As far as he knew, Shirone was a Nephilim who used light magic, but it was dark magic that destroyed Oprica.
The problem is that it is broad daylight with the sun shining down.
It was impossible to use the power of darkness in a place where the spirit of light filled the world, unless one was free from the law.
“Are you going to continue?”
Flew took out the magic wand ‘Phoenix’ from Kubrick and swung it around.
Although he was deprived of the first attack by Shirone, if he had been a little late, the phoenix would have burst out and destroyed the prison.
The gatekeeper’s face contorted in a grim manner.
“Don’t talk nonsense. We are Norse. Don’t be swayed by myths without substance!”
When the gatekeeper cast the sound magic ferry, an ominous sound like a crow crowing filled the sky.
Three Norsemen landed behind the gatekeeper on the wind magic aeos.
It was a Norr guard who was waiting in the vicinity.
“Hey, why are you calling us all? what?”
A bald man among the guards found Shirone and the others and frowned.
“What, those kids?”
“They’re from 1st Command. That blonde hair is Shirone, the light of Area 73.”
“Shirone?”
The bald head stared at Shirone.
Like the gatekeeper, his expression was crumpled in displeasure.
“Ah, that Shirone? You mean the one attached to the lesser Mecha people.”
said Fleur, stepping forward.
“Do you have anyone else to call? We are also busy, so if we are going to do it, do it quickly, right?”
The gatekeeper said to the guards.
“Don’t be alarmed. Their magic has a different magic system from ours.”
“I know. They are far worse than us.”
As Fleur snorted and pushed Phoenix forward, Shirone stepped out on her shoulder.
“I’ll do it, senior.”
No matter how the Norse accepts Shirone, it does not change that she is a key player in the war against Heaven.
In order to mobilize tens of thousands of Norse subordinates to the headquarters, it was necessary to show the Nephilim’s ability from now on.
“good. Instead, finish quickly.”
When Fleur gave up her seat, Shirone walked slowly toward the gatekeeper.
“Take us to headquarters. There is no need to continue fighting meaninglessly, right?”
“Heh, it’s definitely worth the word of mouth. But you know what? That Nor’s real strength starts now.”
The gatekeeper opened his eyes and told his colleagues.
“Prepare Mahagard.”
The bald head looked back with a puzzled expression.
“Mahagart? Do I really have to do that?”
“Did you not hear? He uses strange magic. It’s best to finish it once and for all.”
“Sheesh!”
Bald couldn’t help but obey.
Regardless of rank, the gatekeeper’s judgment was the top priority at the entrance to the headquarters.
The remaining three followed the bald man’s movements.
Ancient magic is not as individualistic as modern magic, but sometimes that tendency can be an advantage.
It was that they could cast collective magic.
Sensing the heavy condensation of the atmosphere around her, Shirone compressed the photons in front of her.
Four Norse cast spells at the same time.
“Mahagart!”
A strong wind that exceeded the density of the aircraft rushed in.
It was a powerful magic that, once swept away, could not even resist and slammed into a wall, causing its limbs to burst.
Shirone gritted his teeth and fired a photon cannon.
A heavy flash of light penetrated the center of the atmosphere, causing the air to crease and ripple.
In the end, it tore Mahagarth to pieces with a ruptured eardrum.
“Aww!”
Mahagard’s aftershock swept in, flapping the Norse’s collar.
The sound waves alone were enough to blow my mind.
“M-Mahagart… … .”
The collective magic of the Norse tribe was as elaborate and powerful as the three-stage combat system of the Mecha tribe.
Magic that can be attempted only when teamwork is perfect.
For such magic to be destroyed by one man’s hand, it was a crushing blow to the pride of Norse fighters.
Flew had already anticipated the outcome.
‘That’s stupid. I should have considered the difference in density.’
No matter how strong the wind is, it cannot displace the photon cannon, which is compressed to a single point.
Therefore, in modern magic, air magic is divided into press type and blow type so that it can be applied to numerous situations.
‘Anyway, I trained quite a bit in a short time.’
The power of the Photon Cannon was much stronger than when he was in the Magic Association. Maybe senior year life helped.
As he trained in shotgun movement and laser judo together, Fleur was happy with Shirone’s growth as if it were his own.
* * *
Shirone and the others followed the gatekeeper into the depths of the forest.
Shirone’s inaction was shocking, but it did not break the heart of the Norse fighters.
The only one they obeyed wholeheartedly was the commander, and they had no doubt that she would lead the Norns to victory.
Even so, the reason why they changed their thoughts was that they were no longer within the scope of their judgment.
There was no way to know how it was activated, but Shirone’s ability to destroy 4 people in one blow was worth reconsidering.
“We will guide you, but don’t expect us to accept you. Because the commander will never allow an alliance with the Meccans.”
Fleur asked.
“What the hell did you split up for? Wasn’t there something that triggered it?”
It is not strange that Mecca and Norr have different ways of thinking, so it is not strange that conflicts arise, but in wartime when there is a common enemy called heaven, it is a universal trend to join forces somehow.
It was her idea that they wouldn’t have split up simply because they were different.
“The Meccans are arrogant. Because they know what the greatest thing is. Nor has a Norman way. But they wouldn’t admit it. War is thinking about winning. I don’t want to work with weaklings again.”
The gatekeeper stopped and set aside the leaves of the shrubbery.
“Everything has come. This is our headquarters.”
Shirone tilted her head. All he could see was a sheer cliff.
“Is this the headquarters?”
When the gatekeeper cast the ferry magic, the unique sound of birds pierced the sky.
After a while, holes were opened in dozens of places in the cliffs, and Norse guards revealed their faces.
As the ground trembled, the cliff began to transform into a fortress.
A door opened on the ground, and a stone staircase descended from a high place.
‘It’s ancient magic.’
It seemed that the Norse, who used the affinity of the natural world, had built a natural fortress by magically shaping the entire mountain.
Upon arriving at the headquarters, Shirone and the others were surrounded by talented people who seemed to be outstanding.
A tall, painted blonde woman approached from the front door with haughty steps.
It was the Norse archmage and the second commander of the rebels, Reisis.
“What’s going on? Purin’s birdsong.”
The gatekeeper stopped Shirone and the others and approached Leisis and whispered something softly.
Flew turned all of the drone’s interpretation into an internal channel and amplified the sound.
A warning window popped up saying that the retinal vision could not collect sound. It seemed to be using magic to block the spread of sound on its own.
“Hmm, got it.”
Reisis, who heard the report, nodded and walked towards Shirone.
A powerful ancient magic with 32% Spirit Force.
Flew kept his vigilance ready to take action.
However, Reisis’ face, which had been expressionless until then, suddenly brightened in front of Shirone.
“Round, Light of Area 73.”
While bewildered by the unexpected hospitality, Reisis opened her arms and hugged Shirone tightly.
She smelled of strong perfume.
The smell of perfume thick like blood.
Resis led Shirone and the others to the stronghold inside the cliff.
At that point, Clove and Gardlock left, and the remaining two were escorted to the commander’s office.
There was a carpet on the floor, and three-person sofas were placed facing each other.
It was certainly a landscape more familiar to Shirone than to the Meccans.
When Laceys, who sat in the seat of honor between the sofas, offered a seat, Shirone and Fleur sat on separate sofas as if they had made an appointment.
A position in which a pincer attack is easy in the event of an emergency.
Reisis looked at their unusual seating arrangement and gave a puzzled smile.
“So, why are you here?”
Shirone said.
“You must be guessing. The 1st Command made an alliance proposal.”
Reisis rested her chin and crossed her legs.
“Allies. Come on now what’s the point? Combined, what do you do?”
Shirone conveyed Sain’s words that persuaded Crud.
Reisis, who heard the story, was also thoughtful with a cautious expression this time.
“Hmm, paralyze the Aegis system. If that happens, it will be good for us too.”
“Once you enter heaven, you can create variables. So why don’t we join hands with First Command and move together?”
“But before that, I want to ask you something.”
Reisis said with a wink in one eye.
“If that’s how you conquer heaven, who will be the king?”
“yes? King?”
“I mean, who is this alliance for? We got along well when we first rebelled. But aren’t you all between the Mecca and the ball now? Do you think the members will obey me even if I order an alliance? already broke up once You reached out your hand first, but there’s no guarantee that you won’t hit the back of the head the second time, right?”
From the standpoint of the Norse, it was obvious that such a thought could not help but be felt.
When Shirone was unable to answer the unexpected difficulty, Reisis continued.
“So I have something I would like to suggest.”
“Any suggestions?”
Reisis’ index finger pointed at Shirone as if stabbing.
“The light of Area 73. If you, the symbol of the rebel war, are transferred to the 2nd Command, I am willing to actively persuade the members.”
Fleur asked.
“It’s not a bad suggestion, but it doesn’t matter, does it? After all, if you form an alliance, you will be united again.”
“Right, it doesn’t matter. That’s why I propose. A Norse isn’t stupid enough to make an offer your opponent will refuse. But shouldn’t we also have insurance when we win the war? The Norse have the symbol of freedom, that’s enough to convince the crew.”
Seeing Fleur nod, Shirone obediently agreed.
Just as Mecha and Nord had their own circumstances, the Shirone team had to move the rebels somehow.
“great. It is the Norse who will be able to use my name when the war is over.”
Reisis crossed her palms with a bright smile.
“Good! Good idea. Shall we go register now?”
“yes? Registration?”
“Now that you’ve entered 2nd Command, of course you have to measure, your Spirit Force.”
* * *
Shirone and Fleur stood in front of two changing rooms that were placed side by side.
In order to measure Spirit Force, several tests were required, one of which was a physical examination.
Fleur said before entering the locker room.
“If something happens, focus on returning here rather than fighting. The most important thing is joining.”
“yes. Seniors, be careful too.”
As the two entered their respective dressing rooms, the two drones followed the owner as if they had separated from each other.
Hearing the door close outside, Flew looked around.
It was a hollow with nothing, and there was only another door installed to enter the interior.
A Norse woman who was waiting approached.
“Take off your clothes and give them to me. I’ll return it to you once the inspection is over.”
“How far should I take it off?”
“Everything. I have to sterilize it in a disinfection room and collect blood and body hair.”
Fleur undid one button on her blouse.
Even after joining 2nd Command, Reisis was still an unreliable woman.
In the worst case scenario, she may be ambushed, but being naked does not diminish her fighting power.
‘Well, clothes don’t have any defense.’
What was more curious was the Norse swordsman.
‘Are you taking blood? What are you going to do with it?’
With that thought in mind, I took off the last remaining underwear and handed it to her, and the woman put it in a basket and said.
“Hey, you have to take that ring off too… … Suck!”
Flew’s eyes, which had been calm even after being naked, suddenly turned cold.
She glared at the woman, then raised her ring finger and pointed at the ring.
“This doesn’t work. If sterilization is the purpose anyway, isn’t a ring irrelevant?”
Kubrick has a phoenix stored in it.
As it was a tool that amplified mana, the ring could not be removed even if the underwear was removed.
“Ah yes. It doesn’t matter. Then this way.”
When the pale woman ran out the door as if to run away, Fleur finally relaxed her expression.
The reason why he deliberately revealed his intention to live was to test the woman’s reaction.
If you tried to get the ring out in any way, it’s because this inspection is also likely to be a trap.
But contrary to my expectations, I couldn’t feel any particular intention from the woman.
‘Did I think too deeply?’
Fleur followed the woman into the next room.

===============================
[424] Second Command (3)
After undressing, Shirone walked through a long tunnel. Gas billowed out from a crack in the wall, sterilizing her body.
There might be some suspicious intentions hidden, so Shirone held her breath and completed the tunnel that wasn’t too long.
Upon entering the next gateway, a large cave appeared.
The sunlight shone through the numerous holes in the ceiling, reminiscent of stars in the night sky.
After staring at the ceiling for a moment, Shirone lowered her head and focused on the strange thing in front of her.
“What is this?”
A huge gel-type liquid lay in a lump like pudding.
As Shirone hesitated, not knowing how to use it, an old man’s voice was heard from the ceiling.
“It is a process of coating the sterilized body. Break right through.”
“Hmm.”
Shirone sent the drone flying toward the entrance first, then took a deep breath and dug into the inside of the gel.
It was slippery like real pudding, so there was no difficulty walking.
However, the feeling became very strange. A slight blush appeared on her face as her sensitive area was stimulated.
When I entered the next room, a warm space with red light came out.
The gel on her body dried in an instant and completely coated Shirone’s body.
“Aha, that’s it.”
Sterilization of 99.99% was completed.
* * *
Arriving at the last room, Shirone was surprised to see so many people wandering around.
Liquids of various colors bubbled in more than 10 glass tubes and flowed in all directions through hoses.
On the table, glass utensils needed for experiments and some parts of creatures of unknown origin were displayed with less blood.
People in white coats were moving busily, and the bald man I met at the entrance was waiting with a snarling expression holding Shirone and Fleur’s clothes.
Commander Reisis approached with a bewitching smile, wearing a red cloak that matched her mood.
Everyone except herself was wearing clothes, so Shirone was a bit shy, but she didn’t have enough experience in combat to show weakness during the mission.
“Where is this?”
When I asked, pretending to be calm, she changed the topic with a smile as if she knew how she felt.
“How about the Norse sterilization system? Isn’t it perfect?”
It was actually like that, so Shirone readily admitted it.
“yes. It was quite systematic.”
Just then, the door on the other side opened and Floo came in.
“Ugh.”
I could barely keep the sound that was about to come out of my mouth.
Flew, on the other hand, looked at the surrounding scenery first, as if he had nothing to shy away from, even in a place where many people were roaming around.
Then, he found Shirone and approached him with great strides.
“Did you come soon? Did everything go well?”
“Ah yes.”
Fleur looked down at Shirone.
Still, as a wizard, Kubrick was sticking with him to the end.
‘Well, if you can’t do this much, you’re just a kid.’
In fact, Shirone also flatly refused the request to remove the ring.
However, he did not check Flew’s hand.
Of course, it doesn’t matter if you do it, but… … She wanted to believe in her.
After confirming that Shirone was safe, Flew carefully inspected the surrounding objects.
‘Biology lab. What the hell are you researching here?’
The scene of the laboratory in the basement of the Magic Association overlapped with the sight of scholars rushing to dissect the organs of unknown creatures on the table.
If the source of the smell of blood in Lacey’s perfume is probably here, then she also resides there.
If it was simply to measure the Spirit Force, there was no reason to wait until the blood smelled.
‘Hmm, it’s definitely suspicious, right?’
Reisis approached Fleur.
“Sorry. Were you surprised? I should have paid more attention to women. However, it is the only laboratory connected to the disinfection room. I need uncontaminated hair and blood.”
Flew confidently stretched one leg out to the side and placed his right hand on his hip.
There was no way he didn’t know that he did it on purpose.
“There’s nothing I can do about a physical examination. But aren’t you wrapping yourself up too tight for someone who says that?”
Lacey laughed cheerfully.
“Ho-ho-ho! Because I am a commander in my own way. Hang in there. I’ll finish it soon and give you clothes.”
A woman with a syringe came over and drew blood from Shirone and Fleur. At the side, two people clung to each other and collected their hair.
Reisis was satisfied with their unconcerned appearance.
“I have studied your magic. A system that mixes the spirit of the Norse with the knowledge of the Meccans. But I think, after all, you guys are closer to Nord.”
Flew, who had been watching the dissection of a huge chunk of meat, turned to Leisis.
“On what basis do you say that?”
“Because I understand the meaninglessness of the body. The Norse are a race preoccupied with the spiritual world. There are many naked and mutilated bodies here. In fact, the human body is nothing more than a set of functions when disassembled. What really matters is contained in it.”
Resis patted her head.
“But the Meccans didn’t understand that. They had fun melting iron, pounding it, and making strange things. In fact, it’s the same with biology experiments. But they hated it and rejected the Norse as uncivilized.”
Shirone could guess where the feud between Mecca and Nor started.
“Sampling is over.”
When the procedure was complete, the bald head brought me the clothes. His expression was not good, perhaps because he was nostalgic for serving as a servant.
Shirone asked.
“When do you measure the Spirit Force?”
“I will start now. Now, look at this.”
Norse scholars dipped blood and parts of their hairs from the two men into a blue liquid.
As the bubbles bubbled up and turned into pale green, thick water, Leices pointed to the elixir separator.
“It’s a drug that comes down to the Norse vision. When green, yellow, and white elixirs are mixed in specific proportions and then fused with the cell body of an organism, a substance that reveals the biological substrate is created. If you neutralize this with distilled water and cast a spell, you can see their affinity.”
“Oh, that’s right.”
Flew came closer, resting his chin on his chin and watching.
It was her first time experimenting with biology using an elixir.
“There is no need to feel pressured. Even if your affinity is low, it doesn’t mean that your skills are low. In a word, it can be seen as an evaluation of your magical potential.”
potential power.
For Shirone and Flew, who were still new to the wizarding society, it was a topic that never left their heads.
Also, since it was an impossible measurement method in the real world, I couldn’t hide my desire to know beyond the mission.
“Can I do it now?”
“no. Tradition dictates that new recruits be tested for affinity in front of the Norse. If you measure privately, words may come out later. Ranks are determined by percentage, and if you train hard, you can get promoted.”
Shirone and Fleur went outside.
Most, if not all, of the headquarters staff were huddled in the clearing.
In the center of the clearing, two drums containing liquid were installed, and a glass tube connected to the floor was bent through the ground and rose to a height of 10 meters.
While inspecting the device, the bald man whimpered and brought in two 20-litre water bottles.
It was a liquid containing Syrone and Flu’s biological substrate.
When it was poured into the drum, the silver liquid submerged in the underground glass tube raised the water level and set it to exactly zero.
Reisis shouted from the podium.
“From now on, the tradition of welcoming new members begins!”
All the Norse turned to her.
“I guarantee there is no trick in measuring the Spirit Force. Also, their positions will be determined according to the results that came out today. Then, we start measuring affinity.”
“I will do it first.”
As Flew rolled up his arms and walked to the device, a bald man in waiting explained the measurement.
“Put your hands in the barrel and get in the mental state to cast the spell. Then, as the pressure of the liquid changes, the water level in the glass tube will rise.”
“Hmm, then should I enter the Spirit Zone?”
The bald head stared at Flu as he dipped his hands in the liquid and pursed his lips as if he remembered all the hardships he had endured.
“For reference, my affinity is 16%.”
“so?”
“It’s a figure that ranks in the top 20 percent of the Norse. I mean, no matter how trivial your magic is, it’s your potential that determines your position. So it’s best to do your best. If you come in as my subordinate, you will be in trouble.”
The bald head pressed his face and whispered.
“Hehe, I saw you earlier. Did you really kill me?”
Flew’s eyes widened.
‘He likes the meaninglessness of the body.’
I didn’t believe it from the beginning, but there was always a sense of trying to cover up or hide something in Reisis’ speech.
Since it is a biological experiment, how is the human body?
‘There’s definitely something.’
Flew stopped thinking and focused on measuring.
If your potential is lower than that of the bald man with his nostrils wide open as if he had treasure-like memories, he would really want to die.
“It begins.”
As Flew went into the Spirit Zone with her eyes wide open, the liquid bubbled and the water level in the glass tube rose steadily.
“Whoaaaa!”
An exclamation erupted from the people.
Their gaze stopped at a point more than 2 meters away.
“Two, twenty… … .”
Affinity 28%.
A murmur was heard from all directions.
If it was 28%, it was an affinity belonging to the highest executive level even in Nord Command.
Even if he learned ancient magic from now on, it was a talent that would make him strong enough in a few years.
The bald man, who had been looking up at the glass tube with his mouth wide open, slowly turned his head to Flew.
Flu, who had been waiting with a bashful smile, patted his bald head and said.
“Then take good care of me from now on, my subordinate.”
“Oh, no, this is it… … .”
“don’t worry. I’m not even curious about the bald man’s body. Of course there’s nothing to see, but ho ho!”
Leaving behind his red bald head, Flew returned to his seat.
Shirone greeted him with a high five.
‘As expected, it’s senior Fleur.’
A senior graduate of the Royal Magic School.
He was a future archmage who reached the official 8th grade at the age of only 22, so in terms of talent alone, he would be one of the best in the kingdom.
“Do well and come. Make sure to show your skills.”
As Shirone walked over to the measuring device, the murmur of the flue died in an instant.
The light of District 73, a symbol of the rebels.
It was the moment when his true face was revealed.
“Whoa.”
Shirone caught her breath and put her hands in the liquid.
As the tense atmosphere weighed on his heart, he strained his eyes and entered the Spirit Zone.
Phew!
The liquid in the barrel couldn’t boil and gushed out like a fountain, splashing water in all directions.
“uh? uh uh uh?”
The Norse raised their heads while making strange noises.
It was over 4 meters tall.
“Nonsense… … .”
Affinity 42%.
I had never seen or heard of such a high level in Norse history.
“What, what? Isn’t it broken?”
Every Norse knows that such a thing is not going to happen.
This is because, unlike the Mecha tribe’s technology that malfunctions, the reaction of matter does not lie.
Even so, the reason I wanted to turn a blind eye to the results was because Shirone’s numbers far exceeded those of the current commander, Resis.
Reisis was silent, slightly furrowing her brow.
’42 percent? Is this a reasonable number?’
Unless you’re learning ancient magic, 42 percent might be just a number.
However, in terms of affinity for magic, that is, talent, it was an unrivaled lumber.
cried the bald head.
“There’s something wrong with this! How can 42 percent come out? It’s not realistically possible!”
Some Norse sympathized with him.
As Resis’ aides, they were at a disadvantage when her power was weakened.
“that’s right! No, even if 42% is true, it’s just potential for Shirone who doesn’t know ancient magic! I can’t admit it!”
“Our commander is Raysis!”
Shirone licked his lips while dipping his hand into the liquid.
To be honest, I didn’t expect the numbers to be this high.
However, he was not foolish enough to give up the opportunity that suddenly came to him to help Resis face up.
When I looked back to agree, Flew raised the corners of her mouth and gave a thumbs up.
“Crush it.”
Turning her head again, Shirone opened the immortal function with all her might.
The water level in the glass tube began to rise rapidly.
70 percent. 80 percent. 90 percent.
“Huh? uh uh uh?”
The heads of the Norse were completely vertical.
finally puong! The glass tube ruptured, and the silver liquid splashed brilliantly.
It was as Shirone expected.
The immortal function, in which the spirit spreads to the whole world, was not something that could be measured with a mere standard of affinity.
“Whoa, are you done now?”
nobody spoke up
There was only one thought running through the heads of everyone watching him.
Nephilim.

[425] Definition of creature (1)
Returning to the Commander’s Office, Reisis put on her red cloak and was lost in thought.
The aide who entered after her noticed and asked cautiously.
“Commander, how is Shirone treated… … ?”
It wouldn’t have mattered if they showed the Nephilim’s ability from the beginning.
Because the Nephilim are such beings.
However, Syrone itself has already exceeded the potential of Reisis.
This will affect the Norse rebels who believe in the Spirit Force in one way or another.
It was a tricky problem for Raysys to deal with.
‘I knew you didn’t trust me, but I never thought they’d stab me in the back like this.’
“Here, Commander. instructions… … .”
The aide spoke again impatiently.
Currently, the outside is full of emotions wondering about Shirone’s position.
As time passed, the thoughts of doubting the absolute status of Reysis inevitably increased.
“Knock-knock-knock!”
Reisis raised her head and smiled, and the aide made a puzzled expression.
She stopped laughing and turned to the aide.
“I finally found the perfect factor to compensate for my flaws.”
“Then Shirone… … .”
“Yes, it absorbs. Shirone’s mighty Spirit Force will become a vessel that can accept the characteristics of any creature. I can’t miss this opportunity.”
The aide rolled his eyeballs here and there.
He saw Shirone’s Spirit Force with his own eyes, so there was no room for disagreement.
But Shirone is a symbol of the rebels.
If public opinion were to go bad, there was room for the cause that had been built so far to collapse in an instant.
Reisis raised an eyebrow and said.
“I know what you are thinking.”
“sorry. However, it is also dangerous for the commander.”
Reisis fluttered her cloak and turned around.
“We create clones by culturing a genetic sample of Shirone. I’ll do a clinical test on Shirone’s clone, and when I’m certain, I’ll absorb it.”
“Is it possible? Shirone is not a subject. Human cloning is a very sensitive field, and even the slightest difference in genetic sequence is likely to fail.”
Although subjects and imitations are the same human beings, they have been passed down through independent generations, with exchanges cut off for a long time.
Even if the number of chromosomes is the same, if the arrangement has changed during evolution, the probability of implantation normally in the incubator for cloning is low.
“Even if it were possible, it might just waste the black elixir.”
“Whoops, no need to worry. Humans are also machines. There are many ways depending on how you design it. I’m already looking forward to it. What abilities can I equip Shirone with?”
Resis made an ecstatic expression and let her imagination run wild, then returned with a fierce look.
“We deal with the military community. I need the genes of many monsters to combine with Shirone’s clone. However, this time only with the powerful ones. Whatever the trait, only the strongest traits are selected and combined.”
“All right.”
When the aide lowered her head and left, Reisis sat on the sofa, crossed her legs, and flicked her red tongue.
Experimenting on the human body of a Nephilim is unprecedented, but if successful, the gains are limitless.
“Whoa, whoa, that sounds like a lot of fun.”
It was a gamble of a lifetime.
* * *
Shirone has been promoted to leader of the riot police, a special unit under the 2nd Command.
Unlike the 1st and 2nd, the 3rd Mobile Squadron to which he belonged was a group that carried out the commander’s direct orders, and the members were also the most elite with over 20% of the Spirit Force.
Fleur, who assisted Shirone and became the vice-captain of the 3rd Mobility Corps, glanced at the three members.
Being the commander of the riot squad was a vertical rise in status, but I couldn’t erase the feeling of being watched.
“It’s kind of annoying. I mean those things.”
“It was to be expected. Ever since I opened Immortal Function.”
Raysis promised to form an alliance with the First Command on the condition that Shirone be incorporated into the Second Command, but the uncomfortable part remained.
Rather than fully trusting her, he decided that it would be better to lay a foundation to shake the power in case of an emergency.
“It is, but… … .”
When Fleur turned her head, the three members of the crew who were watching Shirone hurriedly looked away.
With that alone, he seemed to know roughly what kind of orders he had received from Reis.
‘It must be difficult to shake off during the mission. If there is a chance, is it night?’
While Flew was lost in thought, Jo Won approached.
He was a tall man with a long philtrum, and although he was a subordinate in terms of position, his gaze was extremely overbearing.
“Commander, the first mission has been handed down from the upper level. On the Highlands of Corruption… … .”
“for a moment. Why are you on assignment?”
Flew stopped talking.
“Haven’t we heard? The reporting system is messed up. The leader is definitely Shirone.”
The man kept his mouth shut without a change in his expression, but as the silence grew longer, he lowered his head as if he couldn’t do anything about it.
“sorry. It seems that a misunderstanding has occurred. Because I was the leader before. We will report it to the higher up and correct it so that this does not happen in the future.”
When he bowed down and entered, Flu could no longer be aggressive.
In any case, since we have to move together for the time being, it would be best not to make things that tickle the back of our heads.
“okay. keep talking On the Highlands of Corruption?”
A drone translated Flew’s words.
There was no problem with casual conversation, but he wasn’t quick enough to give instructions in an urgent war.
“There are ancient ruins in the Highlands of Corruption. The rebels call it the ‘Tomb of the Angel’. It may have once been a place where angels came in and out, but now it is simply neglected.”
The history of heaven is a story of a very distant past to the extent that it belongs to a myth to mankind.
But even in such a paradise, ancient times existed, and Shirone and Fleur were intrigued.
“Hmm, what should I do when I go there?”
“Since the ancient ruins are sealed by angels, only angels and Nephilim are allowed to enter. And among the rebels, the only Nephilim still alive is Chief Shirone.”
“Aha, that’s right.”
I could feel Raysis’ will to thoroughly use what was to be used while keeping watch as it was.
I don’t know the relationship between the Norse and wizards, but according to her words, it was definitely a wizard-like mindset.
“good. Then let’s go.”
The ancient ruins of Heaven must have information that would be useful for this project, regardless of personal interest.
‘You have to do this much. Because the seniors are on a more dangerous mission.’
As the spirit of light, Ellizer, was activated, the 3rd Task Force was sent to the plateau of corruption.
* * *
Armin, Siena, Ethella, Kuan.
Moving as a team of four, they camped out in the forest and returned to the mainland early in the morning.
The first impression of the mainland was reminiscent of the World’s Fair where they were.
There was no unified standard, and bizarre creatures were roaming the streets.
The styles of the buildings arranged in a row along the street vary greatly. As if to represent the flow of the times, there was a row of huts, timber houses, brick houses, and mechanical buildings.
“Wow, that’s really cool. You won’t see anything like this anywhere.”
Ethella spoke with an innocent smile, but there was no reply.
It wasn’t revealed when the 10 members of the team gathered together, but when there were only four people left, the distance between Siena and Armin was felt more clearly.
The one who was disturbed was Siena.
I thought Armin would tell me first. He was at least able to explain why he was able to follow him to heaven.
‘You said you left the ivory tower?’
If it was that easy, why didn’t I tell you beforehand?
Even before the question was over, Siena could not stand the tantrum and opened her mouth.
“are you okay?”
Ethella, who was struggling to liven up the atmosphere, suddenly shut her mouth, and after a while, Armin answered.
“what do you mean?”
“I mean Keira. What happened?”
“… … .”
It was a story that could never be told to Siena.
But even aside from that, keeping your mouth shut this time was a courtesy to Keira.
“Are you going to leave the ivory tower?”
Keira glared at Armin with fearful eyes.
I wasn’t shocked because I had already expected it. The problem is, Armin is bound by the ivory tower and the oath of pact.
The condition of the agreement oath, which is the ability of the regular eater, is triggered when the oath is torn, and magic cannot be cast forever.
So Keira took out the oath of the agreement.
At the end of the document, Armin’s signature was clearly engraved.
Since it was the signature he had taken Siena as a hostage from the beginning, he hoped not to tear it as much as possible, but if he wanted to go to death, this was also one way.
“If you go, your relationship with us will end there. If that’s okay with you, get out of this room.”
Armin smiled softly.
He had never shown a smile, so Keira realized it was a goodbye.
“Thank you for that time.”
Although he didn’t show it, Armin knew that Keira had done a lot for him.
“joy! Don’t try to convince me. Don’t act like you’re the only one suffering! Or what? Are you going to stop time again and run away?”
Armin shook his head.
“You can’t use stop magic like that. Because I, who consumed the timeline, am just a burden.”
“What does it matter? Anyway, if I tear up the oath, you’re nothing. I’m just a blind man who can’t even go to the bathroom by himself!”
“Then it is unavoidable. You’ve only been causing trouble so far, so you can do as you please in the end.”
Armin walked towards the door.
Take a picture when you grab the doorknob and turn it! snap! I heard the sound of paper tearing.
Armin looked back in surprise.
The conditions of the oath were fulfilled, but the target was not himself.
“Keira… … .”
Her signature was engraved on one of the oaths that fell to the floor like petals.
Another agreement oath.
Her oath of pact, which she had to take from the Ivory Tower to keep tabs on Armin, is now destroyed.
“go. Because with this, the situation has been established. If you like her that much, go!”
“Keira, I… … .”
“Don’t come any closer!”
Keira shouted.
I didn’t want to remain a miserable figure who received sympathy until the end.
“Go to heaven and protect her. but… … .”
Keira raised her tear-stained face.
“Come back alive. Protect her, and come back alive. You bastard son of the world!”
Armin turned around without a word.
Keira is also an ivory tower wizard recognized by the world.
She never thought that what she had achieved was less than her own.
“I will definitely pay you back.”
Armin, who cast the flicker magic, disappeared in an instant.
Armin’s party arrived at the front gate of the military community on the outskirts of the mainland, aka ‘Night Mang’.
The term military complex boasted an enormous scale, and smoke was rising from all the chimneys towering over the walls.
“I don’t think you need to ask any more.”
Armin walked to the front door.
He brought a drone in case of emergency, but Armin had nothing to use because he was learning the language of Heaven.
“excuse me. this is… … .”
The bodyguards guarding both sides of the main gate closed the gap and blocked the way.
He was wearing a tight suit that was not seen in the original world and wearing glasses studded with black eggs.
“Stop. Who are you?”
“I am here with a request. Can I meet the person in charge?”
As the front door opened, about 10 bodyguards dressed in the same suit blocked Armin’s way with expressionless faces.
“Go back. My brother is in a bad mood today.”
“I’m sorry about that. But we don’t have a lot of time either. Please tell me at least for now.”
A bodyguard with a strong build approached, stroking his fist.
“I don’t mind. Guys, do you know where this is?”
As more than 10 bodyguards spewed out their lives all at once, the energy of a bad temper attacked Armin and his party.
‘This… … .’
All four realized at the same time.
A temperament that could never be felt in the original world.
“Be careful.”
Kuan said as he drew his sword.
“These are not humans.”
