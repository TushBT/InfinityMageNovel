[626] Magic of Banya (3)
A white glow engulfed the Colosseum, leaving the audience unable to confirm anything.
Only the analysts connected to the main system were watching the battlefield through codes.
“That is Ataraxia.”
It was a wide-range ejection magic that was the symbol of Sirone, to the extent that it was even introduced in Spirit magazine.
“What is the impact?”
“About 18 million crashes.”
It was a whopping 7 times higher than the photon cannons of Ataraxia’s bullet system, but the number was no longer surprising.
The flash disappeared and the eyes of the audience moved busily to inspect the battlefield of the huge Colosseum.
“Ambiguous.”
Most of the participants gathered at the end of the Colosseum, and only Eden was spreading the Absolute Barrier in the center.
“Huh!”
She had once blocked Ataraxia’s Photon Cannon in Scramble Royale, but she hadn’t been pushed back 2,000 times.
“I went into orthodoxy.”
He succeeded in splitting the high-output mass waves using his own body as a blade, but it was not enough to withstand the shock.
“Check the parameters.”
“Spirit level dropped by 2%. It was close. It’s a pity from Sirone’s point of view.”
“no. I think I knew.”
As soon as Baikal finished speaking, Sirone moved forward and fired a photon cannon.
‘No one is weak.’
It is not obsessed with fighting the whole thing, but only puts all its energy into defeating the enemy in front of it.
‘Depart from Eden!’
Stepping up like that was the only way to the top of the pyramid.
“Huh!”
Eden, who had spread a local shield, tilted the angle, and the photon cannon’s flash bounced diagonally.
“It is a good choice. Lowering the slope has the same effect as increasing the thickness of the shield.”
‘then… … !’
Watching the rushing participants from behind Eden, Sirone compressed the photon cannon in her right hand.
“Yaaaaa!”
The sphere of light, which had been shaken enough to exceed the realm of vibration, stretched out through the magical action.
“Projectile speed 400 meters per second!”
Eden’s head rang as the photon cannon flew at a speed exceeding the speed of sound and crashed into the shield again.
“Keugh!”
If they collide at this speed, the impact is not dispersed and concentrated at the point no matter how inclined it is.
“Eden! Attack!”
Eden opened his arms as Sirone, who had cast teleportation, jumped into his arms and fired a photon cannon.
“I lost, Sirone.”
A powerful shock hit the brain, and the red light came on in Eden’s bracelet where the Spirit Zone disappeared.
-Participation number 25. 2,000 broke away from the system.
Sirone’s voice was heard in Eden’s ears as he collapsed with all his weight on Sirone’s shoulders.
“great job.”
Her eyes slithered shut.
“thank you.”
A devout follower of the Jordanian religion, Eden would be recorded as not using violence until the very last moment.
“Get it done now! Not twice!”
If Sirone were to open Ataraxia again, there would be no choice but to drop out one after another.
Sirone kicked off the ground towards the participants running from the end of the Colosseum.
An unconscious Eden fell to the floor, and a single flash of light reached the center of the 26 people.
“I’m going to try to the end!”
When Boyle cast Sergeant, a blue-skinned Gaos with bluish electricity appeared.
“Ohh?”
Numerous spines sprouted along its spine, and instead of a tube-like tongue, there was a gun barrel-like hole pierced inside its jaw.
“I see a functional change. It’s a dream.”
Mongsa, which transforms the form of a creature and changes its function, boasted an extremely difficult level of difficulty among bosses.
“I see you for the first time in the graduation exam.”
Instead of raising his tier, Boyle’s choice to practice dreaming was only to pass the graduation exam.
“good! Gaos!”
Aaaaaa!
Gaos, who emits blue electricity, waved his claws, and Sirone teleported away.
“Now!”
In that place, Closer’s Eruption exploded and Sabina’s Wind Cutter flew in.
Subsequently, all 36 prescribed magics reinforced with fire strike, ice wave, and suabi buffs were poured.
‘Poems of fire!’
The moment I distorted space-time and left the radius, the screamer’s back kick, which flew in a flash of light, was stuck in the abdomen.
“Keugh!”
The air exploded with a bang, and Sirone’s body flew away.
“It went right in!”
The screamer’s organs were physical attacks, not magic, so any wizard could be instantly killed once caught.
“An increase in atmospheric pressure has been detected. It is an air shield.”
Although he escaped death by compressing the air in his abdomen, he was on the defensive enough to use magic, which was not his major.
“damn! what a waste!”
Conger rushed to the side where the screamer burst into anger, pulling out dozens of steel wires from between his palms.
‘Sirone. It’s pretty cute.’
Unlike her appearance, Konger is feminine, but like a steel wizard, her magic was at the height of ferocity.
“Death Fence.”
As she spread her arms from side to side, the wires spurted out like a stream of water and attacked Sirone.
If you get caught on a steel wire with sharp thorns sprouting every 10 cm, you will be crushed without a chance to use your hands.
“Huh!”
The wire passed through Sirone’s abdomen as she pulled her back.
“I avoided… … !”
‘You can’t avoid my love that much.’
The steel wires bent like hair burning in the heat and cut Sirone’s arms and legs.
As the mental shock hit her brain, Arin cast the Shadow of Capture and restrained Sirone’s body.
“Canis! It is now!”
‘The Power of Darkness.’
The saw blade-shaped darkness extending from Canis’ shadow flew towards Sirone’s neck.
“Big!”
Sirone, who destroyed Arin’s magic with Geumgangtae’s mental power, cast a berserker without even having time to dodge.
Puff puff puff puff!
The power of darkness fluttered like burnt paper, but a sneer lingered on Canis’ lips.
“I knew you would.”
Book of Light and Darkness – Incarnation Reversal.
The size of the shadow outside the curtain of light swelled like a balloon, and then penetrated the width of the light.
‘Have you penetrated the light?’
Sirone’s body, struck by the power of darkness, was pushed to the end of the Colosseum, buried in the shadows.
‘It’s embarrassing to be this surprised. It’s a technique prepared only to defeat you.’
“Isn’t that okay… … .”
As Sirone was pushed back one after another, sad exclamations leaked out from the audience one by one.
“Who are you to blame? It was self-inflicted.”
Emotions are the same as those of the audience, but Baikal as a scout still adheres to a sober judgment.
“It must have been the only option. admit that But now you have to admit that it’s impossible.”
Elizabeth reported.
“The percentage figure has gone down to 7 percent. If we are not given time to recover, I think we will be eliminated as it is.”
“Goaaaaa!
Cayden, who transformed the cross sword, took the lead, and the other participants followed suit and equipped themselves with magic.
“What are you going to do now, Number 27? If you can’t show me anything more here, your graduation exam is over.”
“Whoa!”
As Sirone exhaled and expanded the spirit zone, the eyes of the crowd gathered at the same time widened.
“what?”
Elizabeth read the change in the main system.
“It’s slow magic.”
The magic that slows down time using the acceleration of light is certainly wonderful, but photonization was the basic of the basics for wizards.
“joy! In the end, what’s left is leftovers!”
As soon as the photonization battery was installed, no matter who said it first, the slowed down time returned to its original state in an instant.
‘Sirone, Slo isn’t for this kind of situation.’
It was a tactic that would only work for an ignorant gang of bandits, unless they were poking loopholes with an instant magic circle like Dante did.
“what?”
Suddenly the slo was released.
At the same time as the participants felt puzzled, the analysts in the VIP seats frowned with headaches.
“Huh!”
Baikal, who heard Elizabeth’s moaning, spoke.
“Looks like you can’t adapt.”
The error caused by the explosion of the Buddha statue dealt a direct blow to the analyst’s brain.
“That’s the same, but this one is a little different.”
“Different?”
“It is not time.”
Elizabeth couldn’t find words to explain for a while.
“The space exists at the same time.
Sibulsangbombing-Force Dimension (fourth-dimensional battle space).
“What is this again?”
The participants rushing towards Sirone were stunned by the phenomenon unfolding in front of them and stopped in a hurry.
Twelve sirones stood in different postures with photon cannons floating above their hands.
“Illusion magic?”
The first sirone fired a flash of light, and photon cannons flew from all directions.
“damn!”
While each body was flying, Cayden bounced the light with his cross sword, and Dante’s instant magic circle collided with tremendous power.
“Keugh!”
Just by looking at the faces of the defenders, the participants were able to guess what was happening here.
“It is not welcome.”
All 12 sirones were real.
“Is it possible?”
Elizabeth could not answer Baikal’s question.
“This is not a matter for a single analyst to comment on. However, from a numerical point of view, it is believed that the time warping ability of No. 27 was implemented through spatial coordinates.”
The only person who could give a clear answer was Miro, who was the first to sense the ability to bomb the statue of Buddha.
‘Time and space are inherently one system.’
When you activate Sibulsang Blast, numerous possibilities, including the past and future, are realized in golden demarcation.
‘In that state, if we use the temporality of slow magic to add another dimension… … .’
Things that only existed as possibilities appear superimposed on the coordinates of reality.
In other words, it governs the 4-dimensional space, which is the same mechanism used by the Guffins to create the upper layer of Istas.
As the time period of the slow magic was consumed to maintain the force dimension, time passed normally, but now the problem was space.
“shit! Where is this!”
The feeling of intimidation when 26 people cornered one Sirone completely disappeared in the face of the reality of having to deal with 12 Sirone.
‘I can fight more like this.’
The efficiency of the Force Dimension depends on the level of slow magic, and the area of the 4-dimensional battle space currently dominated by Sirone has reached a sphere with a diameter of 20 meters.
It’s a number that can’t be called big or small, but at least everyone knew that fighting in this area was suicidal.
“Everyone get out of here!”
While all participants retreated towards the outskirts of the Force Dimension, 12 sirones searched for targets and blinked their eyes.
“The tide has turned!”
In the situation of retreating with victory in front of their eyes, Baikal was also speechless this time.
“Hwashinjutsu is not a measure of strength, but a measure of realization. So it’s not like you can see the effect right away… … .”
Miro said while following Sirone’s movements.
“It has the advantage of being graftable to all magic.”
‘Now!’
Sirone gritted his teeth and cast a photon cannon.
4th dimensional combat formula – Quantum superposition (quantum superposition).
Then, 12 sirones overlapping reality in the space fired flashes at Boyle at the same time.
“Ouch!”
Concentrated shocks hit his back from all sides, sending Boyle’s body to the ground in a massive shock.
-Participation number 17. 2,000 broke away from the system.
The participants who managed to get out of the Force Dimension stared blankly at the fallen Boyle.
Even under such circumstances, the 12 sirones were glaring at all the participants in the 4th dimension battle space.
‘Damn it! How the hell are you going to beat a guy like that?’
In terms of having a headache, it was worse than Infercus, who simply ignorantly attacked in the first evaluation.
“All the skills learned in numerous situations are integrated into one incarnation of the Sibul statue explosion.”
Miro put her chin on her chin and gave a hearty smile.
“The magic of banya started from then.”

[627] Magic of Banya (4)
“Look!”
While everyone was wary of Sirone, only Pandora ran to Boyle.
Seeing him convulsing with her face slumped to the ground, she turned around and shouted.
“Medical staff! I think I am unconscious!”
After turning Boyle over, he tried to clear his airway, but a low cry leaked out.
“Black. Whoops.”
Boyle was in tears.
The appearance of not being able to lift a finger evoked even more miserable feelings in line with the eyes of numerous audiences.
“Why did I… … .”
When I competed for the lead with Pandora in the advanced class, I couldn’t even imagine such a hopeless future.
“I did my best… … .”
The world doesn’t want everyone to be happy.
“You’ve worked hard, Boyle.”
I wasn’t just talking about a year in my senior year.
“Make sure you pass, Pandora.”
Sensing the sincerity of the sympathy at Boyle’s last words as he was being carried away on a stretcher, Pandora glared at Sirone.
“Kuk!”
The moment his eyes met with Sirone, who was wary of his son-in-law without a hint of distraction, he had no choice but to step back without even realizing it.
‘There is no chance of winning in a head-to-head match.’
In front of the harsh reality, my stomach was boiling, but the weak had their own way of fighting.
“I understand, that feeling.”
After receiving first aid treatment, Mark took his seat in the audience.
“Honestly, I didn’t know there would be such a difference.”
Even when he was told to leave by Sirone, resentment ran through his heart, but now that he saw the end of self-denial, only a miserable feeling remained.
“Don’t beat yourself up too much, Mark. Think of it as a good experience.”
As Mark, comforted by Maria, lowered his head while biting his molars, Sade approached.
“Maria is right.”
“Mr. Sade.”
I reflexively looked back, but Mark dropped his head weakly again because he couldn’t bear to look at him.
“I have to admit it honestly. I did my best. But Sirone-senpai and I have different levels of talent.”
“It’s a talent.”
Many people spit out the word talent, but no one actually says that they have that talent.
“Maybe there is something like that. But even if there were, humans aren’t that great, Mark.”
Sade turned his head to look at Sirone and continued.
“No human being can create something out of nothing. That’s not a talent. It’s just that Sirone’s experience, the number of failures, and the number of problems she had to solve were overwhelmingly greater than yours.”
“experience… … What?”
“okay. And now you too have had a valuable experience that no one else can gain through today’s test.”
Mark finally looked back at Sade.
“Only those who rise above failure become stronger. Skill and power aren’t everything.”
Then a familiar voice interrupted.
“A wizard who can respond to all variables?”
Sade looked back in surprise, and Mark and Maria exclaimed with delight.
“Senior Seriel!”
A senior who graduated from Alpheas Magic School a year ago, and Amy’s best friend.
“Hello, Mr. Sade.”
“okay. It’s only been a year. He heard the news that he passed the accreditation. How has he been?”
“I recently got a job as an intern at the World Health Organization.”
Mark’s eyes widened.
‘World Health Organization. You really did it.’
It was a dream job for a recovery wizard and a goal for Maria, whom he had a crush on.
“Oh, good! congratulations!”
“Hehe, I was lucky. There are a lot of issues you know about.”
No one is lucky enough to get a job at the World Health Organization, and that’s why Seriel’s composure made her feel like someone living in another world.
‘Is that the professional aura?’
It wasn’t because he put on make-up and wore a suit, but his confidence came out from his way of speaking and every single one of his actions.
“Come see me after exams. Everyone will be delighted.”
“yes. I’ll see you later.”
When Sade left, Seriel leaned on the back of Mark’s chair and looked down at the Colosseum.
‘Amy. You’re finally back.’
At the graduation exam a year ago, how much guilt did he feel while looking at Amy, who was eliminated early due to the collusion of gold rings?
“Senior, please sit here.”
When Mark stepped aside and gave up his seat, Seriel put her shoulder bag on her lap and sat down.
“thank you. Anyway, things got weird.”
“yes. It’s amazing. Sirone-senpai turned the tide of battle in an instant. On the other hand, senior Amy… … I don’t think I can show my full potential yet.”
Seriel gave a bitter smile at Mark’s honest evaluation.
“Your heart is too soft.”
“yes? Are you Amy senior?”
“I am still undecided.”
Amy had mixed feelings as she looked at Sirone, who spread the Force Dimension and kept an eye on the enemies in all directions.
‘I wish I could have said something.’
I know that there is no room for personal feelings in the graduation exam, but now everyone is an enemy to Sirone.
‘Even on the day you came to see me… … .’
Was Sirone thinking of the current situation?
“Even though she looks like fire on the outside, Amy has a softer heart than me. She can’t turn away when someone is having a hard time, and when she asks for forgiveness, she knows but cares for her.”
After listening to Seriel’s words, it was definitely so.
“It must be more disturbing because it is Sirone-senpai.”
“But it’s okay.”
Seriel proudly watched her best friend compete fiercely in the Colosseum.
“Because Karmis won’t tolerate two mistakes.”
Amy’s crimson eyes burned red.
‘It’s starting now!’
Unlike a year ago, when I was eliminated at the beginning, the current situation is equal, so there was no need to be nervous anymore.
‘Because I just have to take my own graduation exam!’
With Amy moving as a signal flare, the other participants also cast teleportation simultaneously.
At the same time as Sirone rotated, Amy’s fire strike hit Frings, who was aiming for Sirone’s tail.
‘Are you targeting me?’
Frings, who defended himself with the ice curtain, tilted his head, and Iruki, Dorothy, and Hercy attacked the other participants.
“The new system crowds out the old system.”
Baikal’s analysis was correct.
If you can’t defeat Sirone right away, there’s no need to be stubborn at the cost.
Rather, it was judged that it would be more advantageous to pass by using Sirone’s system to eliminate other participants.
There was no room for emotions to intervene in only selfish judgments, and the battle began to escalate into a mess.
“shit! What is it?”
Screamer, still undecided, glared at Sirone in the battlefield where battles were happening simultaneously.
‘I think I’ll collapse if I take one shot.’
Everyone knew that Sirone was exhausted, but it was also true that he could not find a way to destroy the Quantum Super Position.
‘Should I? Do you just accept it?’
Even while the screamers were in conflict, the identification of friends and enemies was happening quickly in Sirone’s head.
‘Anyway, there are no allies. If you’re going to use me, is it better for me to hit the back?’
It’s not a bad choice, but so far the number of those who oppose his system is higher.
‘Let’s start with neutrality.’
When Sirone targeted the screamer and rushed, he, who had been in conflict just a moment ago, hurriedly distanced himself.
‘damn! I can’t be the scapegoat.’
Jumping into the Force Dimension, a space dominated by Sirone, without any countermeasures was tantamount to committing suicide.
‘Whoops, a monster is a monster.’
Fermi, who still had some time to spare, was confined to circling the outskirts, avoiding Sirone’s territory.
‘It’s a four-dimensional space… … .’
The Force Dimension that Sirone developed was a miniature version of the upper layer of Istas, where all events exist simultaneously.
The difference is that the force dimension created by Guffin uses the time period of the stop magic to have no overlapping limit.
‘It’ll be fun. Shall I try drilling it?’
Judging from the magic that Sirone had cast so far, it was clear that the mental strength gauge was below 10%.
‘No, not yet.’
Even so, the ability of Quantum Superposition was so strong that the odds could not be guaranteed, and Fermi was not the type to throw himself into an uncertain battle.
“That’s Sirone.”
Iruki’s father Albino said with a smile.
“The fact that 26 people respond with different methodologies to a system proposed by one person means that there is not much room for digging into it.”
Amy’s father Shakora agreed.
“He’s a kid with a huge presence. It makes perfect sense to say you have control of the battlefield.”
Arganeth stabbed the albino in the side.
“Honey, don’t just talk about Sirone, analyze Iruki too. He’s still my father.”
“You think fast. But too many.”
The analysis of the son ended with that.
“by the way… … .”
Shakora looked at Sirone, the only one in the Colosseum who could roam freely.
“The ability you are showing now will be the reason you were able to do your best in the first evaluation. Is it an improvisation or a calculated strategy from the start?”
“Maybe both.”
The albino gaze followed Sirone.
“A calculating person would never choose that strategy. It’s not like I pushed through without a countermeasure.”
“then… … ?”
“I just know.”
The albino could guess Sirone’s thoughts.
“You must have experienced countless failures, and you must have had similar successes. If you repeat that process, you will know it automatically. Know that no matter what difficulties you face, you will eventually find a solution. You will believe that yourself.”
“… … Is it an insight into oneself?”
“yes. In Yong-roe, it is expressed that the cap of the head has been opened. In other words, it is an accident that flows freely like water.”
Shakora stared at Sirone as she commanded a reaction from her enemies, dominating the battlefield.
“Awesome. Certainly Amy… … .”
“Yes, Iruki… … .”
both said at the same time.
“It deserves to be admired.”
Shakora’s head turned to the albino.
“yes?”
The albino smiled silently as he gazed at Iruki, who was fighting by Shirone’s side.
‘That’s a good problem, kid. Try hard.’
The calculations came and went quickly in Iruki’s thoughts.
‘The number to use Sirone is seven. It’s best to get rid of my nemesis here. The toughest opponent… … .’
Iruki’s gaze was aimed at Dante.
‘It’s you.’
Dante is also the one who uses Sirone’s system, but in this situation anyway, there was no meaning to have as an ally.
‘Atomic Spring!’
As the flames exploded in succession, Dante got out of the way of the explosion with a neat reaction.
‘Yes, I’m going to try it.’
Once at the Royal Magic School, I thought it was an opponent I had to compete with.
Central arithmetic magic circle – Pascal.
As 200 instant magic circles, each emitting a different color, floated around, the audience erupted in cheers.
“It’s a serious start.”
As all sorts of magic poured out due to the action of the automaton, Iruki started teleportation in a zigzag manner.
‘Pascal is a good magic.’
Iruki’s Spirit Zone was doomed to Pascal.
‘But you can’t beat me with logic.’
Overdrive!
As electricity rushed through the circuitry that made up the brain, both eyes flashed and Pascal’s batteries were analyzed in an instant.
‘Cancellation!’
I thought this was the end.
“what?”
However, Pascal was still intact and was aiming at Iruki with 200 pupils raised.
‘Did you set a password?’
A security device using the knot theory was tripled in Pascal’s circuit.
“Couldn’t you have prepared for it?”
After saying that, Dante spread his arms and flew over Pascal, and 200 amplification magic circles overlapped in the form of a tunnel.
Ultra-precise serial magic circle white sword.
“If you are the extreme of logic, I am the architect who handles it.”
Hey hey hey!
A fire strike that went through 200 magic circles in series was amplified and fired with 189 times the power.

[628] Two Systems (1)
Iruki calculated the detonation equation while glaring at the fire strike, which grew in size in an instant.
‘Nuclear Fusion!’
Fire Strike’s body swelled like a balloon and a powerful explosion occurred.
“Keugh!”
The shock of anti-magic hit the minds of all the participants who had already left.
‘I avoided… … .’
The 2,000 times system was powerful enough to judge the entire Colosseum as an attack.
“Are you going to try to finish it?”
Starting from the huge explosion, a melee of biting and biting each other ensued, and even during that time, Fermi was still relaxed.
‘It’s boring enough to be free.’
He had deliberately put on the brakes at the final juncture of passing every year, so it was rather comfortable now that he had lifted the limit.
‘Wait, won’t it be graduation if only 16 people are defeated?’
Why do other students make a fuss about such an easy task?
Blue lightning shimmered in front of Fermi’s eyes, and the lichen approached with spark magic and swung his hand.
Fermi, who opened the distance with his amazing reflexes, blew his burnt bangs and said.
“Isn’t it too soon? If you stick with me, graduation will be over the water.”
Sona’s Hercy approached from Fermi’s side.
“Because that’s your strategy.”
With Fermi, who had so far dominated the graduation exams, it was only natural that participants would be reluctant to engage in a head-to-head confrontation.
“But your time is gone. If we push you, everyone will attack you.”
‘It annoys me.’
Hercy’s analysis was correct, and the struck Fermi said with a pretentious eye smile.
“Look at me. Is there such a thing as old love?”
“gibberish. Do you have any feelings like that?”
Fermi’s shoulders shook as Hersie activated her sonar and Lichen covered her face with rubber tights.
“Quack. Kkkkkkkkk.”
“Don’t be bluffing. All you have left is a miserable end.”
Laughter broke out and stopped.
“Unlike things.”
Fermi’s emotionless face was cold enough to be considered human.
“Kill!”
The horrified Hersie shouted, and the lichen charged at Fermi with a lightning bolt.
‘Magma stream.’
The ground where Fermi pointed his palm melted rapidly, and an enormous amount of magma gushed out.
“It’s advanced fusion magic.”
Combining the air and fire systems required a veteran’s proficiency beyond the level of magic.
“Out-of-regulation eaters. Money buys experiences.”
A huge amount of magma clumped together from the sky and poured down towards the place where Hercy and Licorn were.
“damage!”
As the lava embedded in the ground quickly spread and engulfed the entire Colosseum, everyone soared into the sky.
Between Sirone and Fermi, the two systems controlling the circumstances of the graduation exam, the participants’ heads became complicated.
‘Which side should I stick to?’
Canis didn’t worry.
“I hit sirone.”
Harvest spread a huge palm.
“Keuk, shouldn’t we have to avenge Arcane?”
Arin thought it was dangerous.
“Kanis, fighting Sirone right now… … .”
“I know what you want to say. I’m stubborn, and I’m not good at reasoning.”
“That’s not what I meant. Why do you keep belittling yourself?”
This kind of appearance of Kanis broke my heart the most.
“That’s why we fight. If I step back from here… … I don’t think I will be satisfied no matter what I do in the future.”
Looking at Canis’ menstruation, where the dirty water was slapping, Arin eventually had no choice but to bend his will.
“Okay, let’s go. Because this is our fight.”
As always, Harvest took on the role of the vanguard.
“Hahaha! We are here, Sirone!”
Tension rose in Sirone’s eyes as he checked Canis.
‘As expected of Canis.’
He was a wizard who polished his magic only for combat, and a master of mental strength who competed for the top of the senior class.
“It’s a revenge battle, Sirone.”
“However much.”
The Photon Cannon and the Power of Darkness struck head-on.
When neither side was pushed back, the contrast between black and white became clear, and the scouts murmured with surprised expressions.
“How could that be?”
Most of the magic is overpowered, but one disadvantage of being weak to light overshadows all the advantages of dark magic.
‘My darkness overcomes the light.’
Book of Light and Darkness – Incarnation Reversal.
When the battery of heaven that led Arcane to the Archmage long ago was installed, the forces of darkness began to drive out the light.
“Hahaha! OK, this is it!”
Roaring with arms wide open, Harvest’s body twisted like a twist and turned into a sharp spear and rushed in.
-Drill it through, Harvest!
Numerous sirones simultaneously cast their photon cannons at once, but the spears of shadow did not even budge.
“It is swallowing the light. That number 12, that’s incredible strength.”
Elizabeth searched Kanis’ records.
“I am a disciple of Viltor Arcane. He also showed off his extraordinary ability in physical strength. He was so stubborn.”
If physical strength was the dominant force in the matchmaking world, there would be no other person like Arcane, who had risen to the rank of archmage through dark magic.
“Certainly, a confrontation between opposite sexes is different from power. It’s a battle of who can carry it through.”
“I win this time, Sirone!”
The more Canis concentrated, the faster Harvest turned into a spear of shadows.
“No, Canis.”
Sirone’s movement stopped, and numerous sirones overlapped in the Force Dimension disappeared as if evaporating.
“I will not lose to anyone.”
When I put my right hand behind me with my center of gravity lowered, dozens of sirones started overlapping with afterimages as if vibrating.
‘Concentrate all events on one coordinate.’
As if an earthquake had occurred, Sirone’s body trembled, and a photon cannon was born outside the palm of her hand.
“That’s right.”
Miro said, pointing at the sky with his index finger.
“Extremes meet at the top.”
The ability to engrave time into space had something in common with the incarnation of the Thousand-Handed Guanyin.
The difference is that Sirone’s quantum superposition superimposes the entire event itself, and in this way, the magic concentrated in one coordinate expands into a huge sphere.
Quantum Super Position – 128 stacks.
The power equivalent to as many as 128 sirones throwing their photon cannons at the same time was embodied in a 2-meter-diameter flash and extended toward Harvest.
“Take it away, Harvest!”
“Keeeeeeeeeee!”
The spear of shadow spun with sharp spines behind it, and a huge flash of light swallowed it whole.
Numerous eyes watched the clash of light and darkness.
tinnitus.
“uh?”
The beep seemed to connect both eardrums.
I couldn’t see, and after a while I came to the conclusion that my whole body had lost sensation.
“… … Canis!”
Arin’s voice was heard high in the sky.
‘what? Why do I hear a sound from above?’
I tried to remember, but the moment Harvest collided with the Photon Cannon, my thoughts were paralyzed as if my brain had been removed from the body.
‘Where am I now?’
I shake my face, but I’m not sure if my body actually follows me.
Fortunately, after a while, my eyesight slowly returned.
It was only after another time had passed that I was certain that I was lying in the middle of a lava field created by cooling magma.
‘Falled? I? why?’
“Canis! damage!”
The moment I heard Arin’s voice clearly, a flash of light rushed from the sky.
“Keugh!”
Harvest appeared in front of Canis, who raised her upper body, and took the Photon Cannon with her body.
“Aaaaaagh!”
As the nerves in my body awoke, realistic pain rushed in.
‘Nonsense.’
In other words, the shock he received before he lost consciousness was not real at all.
-Canis, are you okay?
Harvest’s signal came through the mental channel.
-What happened?
-I couldn’t break through. I was pushed out of my strength. I couldn’t move because you lost consciousness.
“I… … You said you were pushed?”
Even though they offset the compatibility between the classes by deciphering the books of light and darkness, they were completely defeated.
“Now! Hit Sirone!”
The contestants who were looking for an opportunity with Canis cutting off the start rushed at the same time.
Even in the midst of Screamer, Conger, and Frings’ pincer attack and Arin’s mental attack, Sirone’s eyes became clearer.
“Is this a wizard capable of responding to all variables?”
Although they were proud of one organ, Sirone was not pushed back while dealing with all of them one-on-one.
Elizabeth said in a trembling voice.
“My mental strength is recovering. It’s already over 30 percent. It’s Runner’s High.”
A light flashed in Sirone’s eyes.
‘Immortal Function!’
The mental power rushing in from the infinite realm further strengthened concentration and the efficiency of the Force Dimension soared.
“36 percent! 40 percent! I keep recovering!”
Everything that makes up Sirone, such as Ataraxia, Elysion, Sibul Statue Explosion, and Immortal Function, is circulating.
“… … Is it a flawless system?”
In fact, even in the state of being caught up in the attacks of the enemies, Sirone’s mind was getting clearer.
‘weird.’
I couldn’t analyze it logically, but it felt as if everyone’s hostile movements had nothing to do with my situation.
‘I don’t think I’ll lose. I don’t think it’s dangerous.’
“The head cap is completely open.”
The albino muttered as he stroked his chin, and Miro’s eyes lit up as if he had found a jewel.
“I started hearing the beating of my heart.”
Foltar turned around as if seeking an explanation, but Miro saw only Sirone’s fluid movements.
‘The time perceived by the brain is split into the heart. That is the identity of rhythm.’
Therefore, those who can hear the heartbeat… … .
“You can split all the time into your own rhythm.”
‘shit! It only takes one room properly… … !’
The screamer pushed Sirone with all his might, but even with all his might, he couldn’t touch a hair.
He was trapped in the rhythm of Sirone.
“Please get hit!”
As the screamer’s body charged fiercely, causing afterimages, Sirone’s rhythm split even more closely.
‘Avoid here.’
A fist passed by the undoubted anchorage, and the variable beat that split the middle of the beat became anchorage again, subdividing time.
“Oohhhh!”
No matter how fast the screamer moved, it was just a puppet that was already trapped in Sirone’s rhythm.
“It’s okay.”
Baikal said.
“Even the one-hit kill technique is useless if it doesn’t match.”
The feeling of being incapacitated by the martial arts he had trained all his life for was the worst misery in a screamer’s life.
“I can’t do this! How can I not get hit… … !”
Other participants are also accusing Sirone with violent magic, but all that time was just an individual incident to Sirone.
‘Ah, that’s right. I… … .’
Sirone’s movement in a trance was like dancing, and since it was an art, not a technique, there could be no waste.
“To do this short, fleeting dance… … .”
Albino realized what kind of life Sirone lived.
“I had to fill most of my life with painful experiences.”
Miro exhaled.
“… … A privilege that only you can enjoy.”
“I am… … !”
A light of conviction exploded in Sirone’s head.
“The strongest!”
Quantum superposition? 240 stacks.
Deed deed deed deed!
Following the body twisting sirone, 239 sirone focused their photon cannons on a single coordinate.
As he swung his arm in that state, a huge flash of light stretched out and hit the screamer’s abdomen.
“Gagging!”
Screamer’s eyes widened as if they would pop out at the shock of an explosion in his brain, and his consciousness was already blown away.
-Participation numbers 10 and 2,000 have departed from the system.
The contestants who felt terrified at the sight of the screamer sprawled out turned their heads with pale faces.
“The strongest?”
It’s hard to believe that it came from a humble personality, but there was nothing rough about the power of dozens of sirones charging.
“okay. It’s your festival, Sirone.”
Miro saw that he deserved it.
“Run like a mad colt.”

[629] Two Systems (2)
Within the Force Dimension, Sirone dominates space and time, and no one seemed to be able to break the absoluteness of that dimension.
Sirone and Fermi were two huge axes that controlled the battlefield, and the goals of the participants could not be thought of without them.
“It is tight. Syrone and Fermi, both are unwavering.”
Etella replied to Shiina’s words.
“It is Fermi who is facing more numbers. Conversely, it can be seen that the participants are more reluctant to Sirone.”
Alpheas, who was sitting crookedly, raised one corner of his mouth.
“The water has risen. That I am the strongest.”
When those words first came out of Sirone’s mouth, no teacher would have doubted their ears.
“I have already broken through the limits of tension. He probably has no thoughts other than passing.”
“no.”
Alpheas’ thoughts were different from Olivia’s.
“I don’t even have that in my head.”
As the 200 light widths overlap, they pulsate through a wall of material that cannot even be described as a mass wave, and Conger and Frings stumble.
‘It looks like it was hit by a lump of metal.’
In reality, the body would have been smashed first.
“Sirone!”
Canis, who cast Limit of Abyss, rushed in with a temporary immortal function.
‘Win! In the name of Master!’
As the huge dark worm, which was embodied as a member of the dark circle, attacked in an arch, Sirone’s movements stopped.
“Me-oh!”
Foltar flinched, but Maze was relaxed.
“It’s not a rhythm that will be broken like this.”
A crack opened in the dark worm’s shadow, and a beam of light exploded, completely dispelling the darkness.
“A triumph of strength.”
Arin’s mind, which cast mind control, was destroyed as it was counterattacked by Geumgangtae’s spirit.
“The Triumph of Mental Power.”
The Shining Chain destroyed all of Conger’s steel wires and flew in, striking his stomach.
“The Triumph of Delicacy.”
The homing photon cannon flew around the ice wave and bombarded the springs without mercy.
“The Triumph of Sensitivity.”
Baikal’s evaluation made Elizabeth shudder.
“It dominates in all areas.”
The situation of subduing competitors’ organs with the same organs came unrealistic to scouts.
“Why wasn’t there any resentment?”
Because it was Alpheas, who was once called a genius, he was able to understand Sirone’s heart.
“Why didn’t you want to give up? That he is a human too.”
Sirone, who single-handedly pushed the enemies, fired a photon cannon while biting her molars.
‘I can’t be a wizard!’
There were 20 years of thinking.
“Gagging!”
-Participation number 6. 2,000 broke away from the system.
Starting with Konger losing consciousness, Sirone’s flashes rushed in even faster.
– Participation number 12. 2,000 broke away from the system.
Canis collapses.
– Participation number 8. 2,000 broke away from the system.
Arin knelt down.
“My mental strength continues to recover. 46 percent. 48 percent.”
The three elements of mind, spirit, and body circulated endlessly around the incarnation, forming infinite power.
“I guess you’re asking if I really did my best.”
The albino said with a meaningful smile.
“I think you’re asking me if I know how long I’ve lived.”
Elizabeth’s voice rose.
“Participation number 18! 20 times! You’re eliminated!”
Binder and Suabi, who were swallowed up by the Force Dimension, fell unconscious from Sirone’s blow.
‘They’re all dying, it’s just.’
Luman escaped the Force Dimension as if he were running away, and Frings, the only survivor within the rhythm of Sirone, did not dare to approach twice.
“Things are getting interesting.”
Miro’s eyes turned to Fermi.
‘What are you going to do? Then you… … Are they really eaten?’
If Syrone got his system through, perhaps all the participants would open fire on Fermi.
‘Hmm, is this a graduation test?’
Even so, Fermi was relaxed, and frowned as if he was fed up with Hercy, who was driving him.
“What a monster.”
Even though Lichen and Richard, former members of the Golden Ring, joined, the situation was still under Fermi’s control.
At that moment, Fermi’s cold gaze was aimed at Hersy.
“It’s kids’ play. Like two thousand times.”
Calamity Magic – Black Death (Black Death).
Black smoke rose from Fermi’s body and spread in all directions.
“what… … !”
The teachers jumped up and the Scout’s eyes widened.
“Isn’t that black magic?”
“I know it has already been lost.”
It was the magic of Carnes, the sorceress of the black line who once traveled around the world and slaughtered as many as 3 million people.
Fermi tore his mouth wickedly.
“This is the power of money.”
Smoke spread as if an explosion had occurred in the center, and black demons came out from the outside of the cumulus cloud.
“damage! If you get caught, it’s over!”
All participants escaped the smoke, but only a few escaped the demon.
“No. 15 (closer) eliminated! No. 23 (Hercy) eliminated! No. 13 (Dorothy) is eliminated! Number 19 (Pandora) eliminated!”
At the same time, with four players eliminated, scouts began to review the rules.
“Can I use black magic?”
In reality, the participants who were possessed by evil spirits would have died in the pain of rotting flesh.
“There is no problem with the regulations as long as two thousand times can be implemented. However, it is a magic that has been banned from the red line, so I think there will be some talk later.”
Lara said.
“Black Death is evil because it cannot be targeted arbitrarily. So it is strong. The dropouts will be furious.”
“I can’t see it being particularly unlucky.”
Said Baikal, looking at Sirone and Fermi alternately.
“Anyway, they were the ones who chose number one.”
As the effect of Black Death disappeared, the battle entered a lull.
It was because the minds of the participants were complicated while 9 people were eliminated due to the attack of Sirone and Fermi.
‘Now there are 16 survivors left.’
Graduation was guaranteed if six more students fell.
‘For me to come all the way here.’
That’s why Maya, who had to earn the stigma of being the first to drop out of the graduation exam every year, had a pounding heart.
She felt that she benefited from the interlocking of Fermi and Sirone’s systems, but it was not a major issue for her.
“Chief, I think your sister might pass.”
The mystery tribesmen sitting in the corner of the audience seat gathered their hands together with desperate eyes.
“Maya… … .”
Although he was unfamiliar with magic, he could confirm that Maya’s skills were inferior even with the chief’s eyes.
‘Poor kid.’
Maya is a genius, but the place she was meant to be was not on a battlefield where cool-headedness reigns.
‘I will definitely pass.’
For the sake of the people of her tribe, she could accept her fate as much as she wanted, but the reality was harsh.
‘Mayada.’
‘I have to eliminate Maya first.’
Eliminating the weakest Maya in a situation where the probability of acceptance increases dramatically even if only one person falls is the standard.
As Fishaw, Luman, and Sabina attacked from three directions, Maya felt her eyes go dark.
‘I can’t fall from here!’
With desperate determination, Cayden blocked Maya’s way and started attacking the three.
“why?”
The most incomprehensible thing about this graduation exam was Cayden’s response.
I heard rumors that the faction led by Fermi was disbanded, but the biggest reason she was able to come this far because of her poor skills is because Caden always appeared at the decisive moment and preoccupied the position.
‘It must be a coincidence.’
There was no reason for Caden to fight for himself, whom he was not particularly close to, in the graduation exam, where personal feelings were not allowed.
“The confrontation structure is getting complicated.”
It was the biggest turning point in the graduation exam, and it was the point at which the distinction between peers truly disappeared.
‘Rapid Stream!’
Dark blue water whirled around Pony and violently swept it in all directions.
‘Mother, are you watching? To see your daughter carve out a future for herself.’
“Gross weight 4.2 tons. Torrent coefficient 3.3. Kinetic energy per unit area is 983 water per cubic meter.”
Elizabeth analyzed it, but Baikal did not answer.
“Please evaluate. Currently only 11 ratings are unrecorded.”
“… … It is S.”
“yes?”
Lara turned her head in surprise.
“There was an order from above.”
Pony was royalty.
“but… … .”
“The powers of the royal family exceed those of the Society. Write it as S.”
Baikal was also not to my liking.
“It is the reality of royal rule. Don’t analyze number 11 from now on. No matter what grade you give, all magical institutions under the kingdom will bow their heads and take you there.”
“… … All right.”
As Lara wrote in the notebook, Baikal added a word.
“Of course, I have to pass first, but I mean.”
In a situation where the final 10th place was in sight, it was a foolish choice to challenge Sirone and Fermi, and there was still no dropout in the fierce battle of notice.
‘For now, graduation is confirmed.’
Having already grasped the situation, Fermi traversed the chaotic battlefield, waiting for others to self-destruct.
“huh?”
Then, the flashes of the Photon Cannon rushed in.
‘Ghost Movement!’
He tilted his upper body with an automatic response algorithm and saw Sirone flying into his eyes.
‘Fermi. I won’t pass as much as you.’
Seeing Sirone’s thoughts, Fermi’s eyes filled with wickedness.
‘As expected, he’s an excellent idiot!’
The audience’s attention was focused when the two people who received the S grade in the scout’s evaluation collided head-on.
There could be no disagreement about Fermi’s ability to use numerous high-level magic like magic and deal with the Quantum Super Position.
“It’s definitely number one.”
The more that happened, the more Sirone’s anger grew.
‘I can’t forgive you!’
All of Fermi’s magic was purchased from the defeat of the students who did their best for six years.
‘Yes, I know. You must hate me.’
Imagining Sirone’s fury, Fermi conjured up an even more sinister idea in a chilling shudder.
‘If blocking the opponent’s desire is victory… … .’
Disaster Magic – Black Death.
‘I’ll pass the exam with a smile, Sirone!’
Black smoke rose, and evil spirits born from the evil energy spread out in all directions.
If 6 people were eliminated here, even if Sirone killed herself, she would not be able to prevent her from passing.
‘Amgu!’
As many as 200 sirones cast Dark Ball at the same time, Black Death’s smoke rotated like a whirlpool and was sucked in.
‘You’re really struggling, Sirone.’
Fermi snorted and charged at Sirone.
‘Yeah, but you can’t drop me. Any magic other than ataraxia won’t work.’
At that moment, the incarnation of a light angel rose hugely from Sirone’s body, which destroyed the Force Dimension.
“I-what is that?”
The eyes of the onlookers widened at the sight of the incarnation, which had only spread over time, revealing its true nature for the first time.
‘more! Faster!’
As the sequence raced at a terrifying speed, the light angel spread its wings and soared high into the sky.
“Finally integrated.”
Miro’s eyes twinkled.
It was the moment when the true art of incarnation, the particle of God, Sirone’s omniscience, was grafted onto the incarnation of the light angel.
The light angel who flew up to the top of the Colosseum lifted his spear and aimed it at the ground. As the time machine was converted into a space machine, tremendous kinetic energy began to be concentrated on the spear.
‘What is that again?’
Fermi, who was looking up at the light angel blankly, realized something and cast teleportation.
“Sir… … !”
Incarnation – Angelic Punishment.
The spear pierced by the light angel ran at a speed that the eye could not keep up with, connecting the beginning and end of the coordinates with a line of light.
“Quaaaaagh!”
At the same time, Fermi’s body, which had been moving in a flash of light, was pierced by a spear of light, like a fish pierced by a harpoon.
“I plugged it in while teleporting!”
The terminal speed beyond common sense, and the power generated by that speed sprinted, leaving a tail of 0 on Elizabeth’s retinas.
12,000,000 crashes.

=============YYYYY=============
[630] Two Systems (3)
Even if it was 2,000 times, the power of two-thirds of the photon cannon cast by Ataraxia would not be able to handle.
“Aaaaaagh!”
When Fermi collapsed on the floor and struggled, without hesitation anyone stopped the battle and looked around.
“Fermiga… … .”
He is screaming and suffering.
Students who knew him, as well as teachers, saw the sight for the first time, and the Colosseum was enveloped in silence.
“12 million crashes?”
In reality, the entire radius would have been devastated. Rather, it was fortunate that it was 2,000 times converted into numbers.
“Power is not the issue. It doesn’t have much mass, but it plunged at a speed far exceeding the speed of sound.”
If God’s punishment uses high-altitude potential energy, angel’s punishment creates kinetic energy through the reversal of time and space.
The power itself is nothing compared to God’s punishment, but the precision strike ability using incarnation and the high-speed projectile that cannot be avoided even with instant movement were insufficient to explain even with the name of over power.
“haha.”
Glaring at Fermi, who was spreading across the ground and shivering, Sirone let out a rough breath.
The incarnation is a state, but the angel’s punishment had to consume mental power because it was grafted with magic.
“It’s down to a percentage figure of 27 percent.”
‘Inconsiderate.’
For a moment, the meaning of the world was blocked and mental power began to recover through Immortal Function.
“30 percent. 32 percent. It goes up again.”
Elizabeth was no longer surprised.
“It’s a near-perfect mechanism.”
It wasn’t just the use of high-efficiency magic, but numerous functions were endlessly combined as needed.
“Aaaaaaa!”
When Fermi stood up screaming, the audience felt fear as if they were reading a scene from a horror novel.
“Did you survive that?”
Elizabeth reported.
“Spirit gauge is 50%. It’s magic.”
It was impossible to fill half of the mental power without an equivalent exchange.
The Deal of Depreciation – The Devil’s Penalty.
The efficiency of magic could be doubled by giving up the ownership of all property earned through eating out, but once cast, magic was magic accompanied by the risk of contract cancellation.
“I changed my mind.”
Fermi only glared at Sirone.
“I will drop you.”
Transactions in depreciation-detonation strength.
Kururrureung!
Dense dark clouds gathered in the sky like a whirlpool, filled with flames as if on fire, and a blizzard of lightning raged.
“Climate magic detonation force. The damn black line.”
The red line archmages are supported by the kingdom, but the black line wizards have always needed money.
Of course, the archmage Pentaros, who was also ranked in the top 100 most dangerous people in the world, wouldn’t pass on magic for a mere piece of gold, but it was also true that he would lend it for free if it was interesting.
“I made a deal with the intention of destroying the balance of the graduation exam. This is a clear attack on the red line. We have to protest against Pentaros at the association level.”
“The agreement was not broken. Because he didn’t come out on his own. Anyway, that’s not the problem. Detonation steel controls all phenomena in the natural world.”
Fermi floated like a god and looked down at Sirone.
“die.”
Flames of fire fell simultaneously with lightning strikes, and sharp hailstones rained recklessly like a localized shower.
As the wind, sharper than the blade, swept past, Sirone’s mental strength gauge began to degrade horribly.
‘It’s a great power. I’ll be pushed away like this.’
It is time to counterattack, but Fermi was not even visible because it was buried in dark clouds.
“Ha ha ha ha ha! How does it feel to be a frog in the well?”
In front of the ferocious phenomena created by nature, other participants could not even dare to dig into them.
“it’s annoying. What kind of graduation exam does magic like that appear in?”
As Luman said, it was the highest level of magic on the black line, and even the teachers at the magic school could not guess the power of magic that went against the laws of nature.
“Great overpower. Fermi won’t last long either.”
“The percentage numbers are dropping fast. Calculated at my current pace, I will be exhausted in 5 minutes.”
Ignoring the aftermath, I only intended to drop Sirone.
‘I can’t give up here!’
As he burrowed into the dark clouds of the detonation river, a huge electric charge clung to him, and electricity flowed through his entire body.
“The only way to catch a demon is to go to hell.”
“Sirone’s mental strength is rapidly depleting. Exhausted after 3 minutes.”
The sound of thunder from the dark clouds echoed through the Colosseum.
‘I won, Sirone.’
Fermi looked at Sirone’s increasingly pale face with pleasure.
‘Should I do another year? Let’s have fun together.’
After this battle, he will be eliminated as well, but wouldn’t hell be a fun place with Sirone?
“Huh!”
As Sirone, who opened the immortal function, squeezed the photon cannon with all her might, Fermi quickly retreated.
‘It’s enough to avoid it.’
At that moment, my head started spinning and the landscape was distorted dizzily.
“what… … ?”
“It’s about time.”
Boyle, sitting in the audience, turned to Pandora.
“Is it time?”
“Scent magic, paralyzing pleasure. It’s a strategy Master Mael taught me. It is colorless and odorless, so you won’t be poisoned without knowing it. The downside is that it takes a long time.”
“To Fermi?”
“I accumulated little by little. Because it was the only way I could fight. I didn’t even get to that level in the end… … .”
Pandora looked up at the detonated river.
“At least bite your heels.”
“Big!”
A photon cannon flew right in front of Fermi, who twisted his nose.
“Aaaaaaa!”
He screamed and leaned his upper body as if he was about to break, and a flash of light passed by his ear.
‘I’m not the type to be bitten by insects!’
When Fermi spread his arms wide, the detonation river rumbled and a powerful electric shock struck Sirone.
“finished!”
1 second to here.
‘Poems of fire!’
Sirone, who approached with numerous golden lines, compressed the single-shot Photon Cannon.
“this… … !”
Back and forth, each time I calculated the space to avoid in my head, the afterimage of Sirone scattered in all directions, and finally, a flash of light pierced Fermi’s abdomen.
“Gagging!”
– Participation number 1. 2,000 broke away from the system.
There was shock in everyone’s eyes looking up at the dark clouds.
“Fermiga… … I was eliminated.”
When the dark clouds over the detonation river disappeared and Fermi fell to the ground, everyone who knew him was stunned.
“Fermi’s Eating Out Diet is definitely a wonderful magic.”
Alpheas looked at the end of his student and said bitterly.
“But a wizard’s pride cannot be bought with money.”
In the consciousness of moving away, Fermi caught sight of Sirone floating in the position of the victor.
‘Incarnation art.’
And numerous magics associated with that incarnation.
“That… … .”
Fermi’s eyes closed.
‘I can’t buy it no matter how much I pay.’
With a thud, his body fell to the ground.
No one accepted him, and he was just watching indifferently as he lost consciousness.
“Porridge, is it dead?”
Olivia answered the questions from the audience.
“The impact was smaller than expected. It’s an automatic response algorithm.”
Alpheas burst out laughing.
“I really can’t stand it.”
It could be said that it was Fermi-like that he was so confident and was thinking about the possibility of defeat.
“Keugh!”
Cirone, who came down to the ground, grabbed her chest and throbbed.
“I’m pretty weak. Well, it’s natural.”
No matter how excellent the system was, the recovery efficiency was bound to continue to drop.
‘Now there are 15 left. Fermi is out and Syrone is tired.’
It was the moment when graduation became a reality in everyone’s head.
‘5 people, 5 people have to be eliminated.’
While everyone was looking at each other, Luman raised the corner of his mouth.
‘The team is down, but… … .’
From the start, crowd control technicians didn’t need allies.
‘I control the battlefield!’
Crowd Control – Anthill.
As Luman concentrated, his flesh trembled, and a huge amount of dirt rose from the outside of the Colosseum and covered it in the shape of a dome.
“It’s a great size.”
“It is a maze with anti-magic applied. It will be difficult to get out of that.”
The fact that the crowd control wizards came to the fore meant that they had perfect confidence.
“damn! What are you thinking?”
Confined in a hemispherical labyrinth where no light enters, each participant casts Shining Magic.
‘Hehe, the clever guy.’
Only Fjord, located in the center of the dome, realized his intention and shook his shoulders.
“You dare to use me?”
But it was an excellent strategy that I had no choice but to follow.
“Then I’d be happy… … .”
Fjord’s hands drew a circle, radiating green light.
Mass destruction magic? Fryers.
A huge amount of toxic gas exploded around him and sped through the complex tunnel.
“It’s poison magic! The mental strength levels of most of the participants are dropping rapidly.”
“Does the one who perseveres graduate?”
“Aaaaaaa!”
It is not possible to look inside the anthill, but the audience’s faces turn pale at the sound of screams coming through the walls.
‘exit! Where is the exit?’
In addition to being in a three-dimensional maze, anti-magic was hung on the walls, so it was difficult to clearly identify the location even in the Spirit Zone.
“Not a bad situation.”
Richard, who had detoxified the poison coming into his body, spewed gas through the exit port on his side, and Fisho walked around the dark tunnel wearing a large beetle that detoxifies the poison like a gas mask.
“I will end here.”
Insect Magic – Parasite.
Half of his right arm was mushy and crumbled to a paste, then transformed into the upper half of an insect resembling a pill bug.
It was a parasite called Argones given to him by his teacher Keylor.
“Fisho!”
Amy jumped out of one of the six tunnels and stopped.
‘A fisho, of course.’
Her crimson eyes flashed quickly, but the shock of the deadly poison was dropping her mental power faster than that.
‘I’m at a disadvantage here.’
In addition to being an enclosed space, it was a loss to face a fisho that could detoxify the poison.
‘Is the scapegoat Amy?’
If I were to judge my feelings toward her as likes or dislikes, they were always close to likes.
‘He always works hard.’
To put it likewise, it was the heart of an older brother who had compassion for his younger sister.
“It’s a pity. You were unlucky to meet me.”
“You are talking nonsense! Where is the luck for the graduation exam?”
Seeing Amy, who was still strong, relieved her conscience a little.
“I won’t treat you harshly.”
When Fisho raised his right arm, Argones opened his jaw wide and let out a groan.
‘I need to find Maya!’
Cayden ran frantically through the tunnel of the anthill, looking for Maya.
‘I won’t be able to stand it.’
It was not a shock that Maya, who was weak in spirit, could not handle, even if the other participants did not know.
‘wait! Maya!’
Cayden moved his feet even faster as he calmed down his mind, which had been disturbed by the shock of the deadly poison.
‘That’s it.’
Falling down in the clearing of the anthill, Maya blinked like a dying animal.
I did my best, but it was a pitiful test in which luck was everything rather than skill.
‘Now I won’t be able to go to school anymore.’
Since he has to feed his younger siblings, he will have to go back to the Mystic Tribe and do business.
At that moment, footsteps were heard, and someone’s silhouette shimmered in the poisonous gas.
‘I can’t even fight anyway.’
“Maya?”
The moment she heard the voice, her eyes widened.
“Sirone?”
Seeing Sirone’s face approaching without warning, his heart started to beat.
‘no. How hard I’ve endured… … .’
Maybe someone more precious than life.
“Maya, are you okay?”
A friendly voice unbolts the bolts.
“Huh, black.”
In the end, Maya, who was crying, cried like an idiot.
“To Sirone… … .”

[631] What Really Matters (1)
Fire mist heated the air and fire strikes rained down on the fishoes.
‘I can’t cast insect magic anyway!’
Since it was a fisho that handles creatures, it was the same that its skills were limited in places where toxic gas spread.
‘One thing bothers me… … .’
It was an ugly form of insect that was attached instead of Fisho’s right arm.
‘Is it a parasite?’
If you put a poisonous insect on your face and detoxify the gas, the insect connected to your body will also be able to survive.
“It’s no use, Amy.”
Although he was hit by several fire strikes, Fisho did not waver.
‘It’s an ability I’ve never seen before.’
If it was a living organism parasitic on the body, there was no problem with the determination of incarnation.
‘Then I’ll cut you off!’
Key eh eh!
As Fisho’s arms stretched out, Argones popped out with his jaw wide open.
“About this much!”
It was an easy dodge for the schema user, and Amy approached Fisho and slammed his arm into the capital.
It had the power to break bones, but surprisingly, there were no bones.
‘What the hell?’
The moment he felt a soft sensation, Fishaw grabbed Amy with the other hand.
‘You’re going to try boxing?’
Amy twisted her legs to increase rotational power, and when she lifted Fishaw’s abdomen, there was a thump and her fist pierced his stomach.
Goosebumps at the grotesque sensation took a while for Amy to make a cold-hearted decision.
‘I have to burst my heart!’
The hand that penetrated his stomach grabbed Fishaw’s heart, but all he felt was a soft sensation again.
“I am no longer human.”
The moment he heard Fisho’s grave voice, Argones bit Amy on the back.
“Huh!”
“Do not be afraid. Because you passed the test.”
The fist in her stomach slid out, and the expression on Amy’s face disappeared.
“As my faithful servant.”
Alien creature Argones.
This creature, which was first reported to the academic world 230 years ago, is estimated to have flown from outside the solar system on a meteorite, and boasts a strong enough activity to maintain life force while breaking through the atmosphere.
It kneads the cells of the host and changes the body into a completely different biological material, but since the appearance remains the same, the academic world predicts that there will be a significant number of humans infected with Argones.
“you… … you… … .”
Amy desperately moved her frozen tongue.
“How wonderful. Remaining conscious even in an infected state.”
Argones parasitic on the body of the host infiltrates the pilot insert into other organisms and takes control of the central nervous system.
‘no. I lost control.’
I kept trying to back up my self-image memories, but my body couldn’t move as I wanted.
“Don’t struggle. Because only you suffer.”
Like a child blindly trusting its mother, her body reacted to Fishaw’s instructions.
“In my body… … what are you doing… … I did.”
When Fisho raised his right arm, the dough-like form gradually returned to that of a human.
“Lifespan is, after all, just a function created during the evolution of cells. Argones, which has no life expectancy itself, assimilates into the body of the host and maintains vital activity forever.”
It was a kind of eternal life.
“But it’s only theoretical.”
Fishaw lowered his arm helplessly.
“The human body, in which cell division has stopped, continues to accumulate errors, and I too will one day become a vegetative person covered with cancer cells.”
That was the fate of humans who accepted Argones.
“do not worry. Because you don’t become a monster like me. When the test is over, I’ll extract it for you.”
“Only… … on the test… … to pass… … .”
“I just donated my body for the advancement of biology. When the graduation exams are over, you will be put in a quarantine facility.”
One day, cancer cells will spread to the brain and burn it, but Fisho’s intellectual curiosity was strong enough to surpass it.
“Let’s go, Amy.”
Driven by a genetic urge to obey, Amy slowly turned and followed Pishaw.
* * *
“To Sirone… … .”
Sirone knelt down in front of Maya, who was crying with tears running down her nose, and touched her forehead.
“It’s too hard… … . I want to stop… … .”
People in the world revere wizards, but Maya, who lived with them, was sick of hearing the word magic.
“Everyone is crazy. I think I will go crazy if I stay any longer.”
Even Sirone knew that it was a world that a normal mind could not endure.
“It’s not long. little bit more… … .”
“I can’t. My tribe, my siblings, I can’t think of anything anymore.”
Maya closed her eyes and sobbed.
“I’m just… … a little more of you… … I want to love you… … .”
Maya will not be able to hold out.
“finally… … sing… … to call… … try hard… … .”
Looking at Maya who was twitching her limbs, Sirone made a decision.
“Let’s go, Maya.”
It wasn’t a bad situation for Sirone either, as the combination of Luman’s anthill and Fjord’s toxic gas would weaken the spirits of her rivals.
‘I can’t love you… … .’
As I refocused my mental powers, which had been recovered for a while, the incarnation of a light angel rose up and aimed a spear at the outside.
‘Elysion!’
Jikji’s senses broke through the anti-magic and captured Luman’s location outside the anthill.
“I can give you one more chance.”
Incarnation – Angelic Punishment.
Luman’s eyes widened as he escaped the anthill as the window of light penetrated the inside wall.
“what!”
By the time he uttered the sound, the flash had already passed through his torso.
“Gagging!”
– Entry No. 16. 2,000 broke away from the system.
When Luman lost consciousness, the anthill disappeared as if it were collapsing, and the confined participants quickly looked around.
‘Sheesh, you hit Luman. I just had to hold on a little longer.’
Even if it dragged on for about 10 more minutes, there would have been a dropout, and it was an easy situation to graduate.
‘Maya! What about Maya?’
Cayden only thought of Maya, and when he found her in Sirone’s arms, he looked incomprehensible.
“why… … ?”
On the other hand, Iruki quickly grasped the situation.
“That’s how it happened.”
Eliminating Luman to save Maya.
‘A clear emotional judgment. If that’s also the privilege of the strong, it’s not an issue… … .’
It was true that I was regretful because I wanted to graduate together.
‘Are you really going to be okay? It’s definitely a handshake this time.’
Sirone put Maya down slowly.
“This is all I can do.”
“Sirone… … .”
I couldn’t analyze it accurately like Iruki, but I could tell by feeling that Shirone had sacrificed something.
“Hold on a little longer. So that you don’t regret it later.”
That alone made Maya feel like she had everything.
“Whoa, I’m tired.”
Sirone, who bent her neck and moved toward the participants, slowly raised her hand and gestured for them to attack.
At the same time, Cayden raised his cross sword and charged.
‘I couldn’t protect Maya!’
The moment Sirone opened his eyes and tried to take the attack, Cayden ran straight past him to Maya.
“Taha!”
As he blocked Maya’s way, he twisted and raised the sword, and Richard’s metal arm ricocheted off.
“Sheesh!”
It was common sense to aim for Maya in a situation where graduation was guaranteed if only four students were eliminated, and Richard did not like Kayden’s judgment that broke that common sense.
“Don’t you care about the test? You are crazy too.”
“Wouldn’t that be what you were saying?”
I didn’t want to hear that I was crazy for a human who had 35 percent of my body altered.
‘If only May could be happy… … !’
It’s been a long time since I’ve already transcended jealousy.
‘I can be unhappy as much as I want!’
Demon Sword – Mega Tornado.
Richard, who was blown into the air by the strong wind, quickly regained his balance and captured Maya with his mechanical eyes.
‘Remove Maya first!’
As the magic crystal of flame was installed, it spewed fire, and Kayden swung his crosssword towards the pouring flames.
“Yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
As the cold air raged and extinguished the flames, Richard’s right arm rotated 45 degrees and applied another attribute.
‘That’s right!’
Meanwhile, other participants were intensively attacking Sirone.
‘The reaction has definitely slowed down! We win!’
Through the eyes of the scouts, his exhausted appearance, unable to even unfold the Force Dimension, was being analyzed.
“After defeating Luman, my Spirit level dropped to 4%. Will it end here?”
Baikal was also a pity.
“The price for emotional judgment. That’s why wizards have to be cool.”
Amy, who had abandoned her long-term sniper technique, was pouring physical attacks with her red eyes blinking nonstop.
‘Am I being manipulated by something?’
At that time, when the fact that the backup speed of the self-image memory was not normal increased the feeling, Amy spat out the words.
“Stupid Sirone.”
“what?”
Losing control of my body, I couldn’t even stop my thoughts from popping out into my voice.
“You mean Maya is more important than the graduation exam?”
“that… … !”
Shirone, frightened by the blatant words, backed away in succession, and Iruki clicked his tongue and flew in.
“It’s self-employed. Why do you sympathize?”
A series of atomic bomb blasts attacked Sirone, and Sabina blasted wind cutters into the blast.
“Big!”
In a situation where it was burdensome to even maintain the fire, the level of mental strength continued to drop.
“Waaaaaaa!”
When Sirone, who had dominated the competition so far, was in danger of being eliminated, the cheers of the audience were heard louder than usual.
“Very s@distic… … .”
Baikal said.
“It’s p*rnography.”
Elizabeth couldn’t deny it.
“Talented people who have dedicated their lives to one path are frustrated when they encounter limitations. Is there anything more fun to see than this?”
As a scout, I watched countless competitions.
“Talent, hard work, or wealth. If you make a small concession in anything, the entire human race can be happy right now. But that has never happened in history. That’s why I think it’s not that I won’t do it, it’s that I can’t do it.”
“On the other hand, it is also true that such a fighting spirit has developed mankind.”
“Of course it is. What I want to say is… … .”
What I really want to know.
“If everyone is happy, why do we need progress?”
What are we fighting for?
“Of course, I also came to this position through competition. That’s why judgment number 27 is the worst. It’s just that sometimes, you don’t know what’s really important.”
‘This is not it!’
Amy, who burned her red eyes, escaped from the parasite’s mental control and fired fire strikes in all directions.
‘Was there a place I couldn’t reach?’
I felt a deeper realm in Amy’s psyche that was beyond the reach of domination.
‘How dare you shame me?’
Elizabeth shouted as Amy, who entered the sword, heated up the cells with the battery of fire.
“My body temperature is over 42 degrees! It is dangerous in this state!”
‘Looks like you’re trying to extract the pilot insert.’
Since it was already settled in the human environment, it would not be able to withstand and escape if the heat was rapidly raised.
‘But you can die. Do you really want that?’
‘Come out! Get out of my body!’
Even in the middle of a daze, the self-image memory found the pilot Insect that dominated the center, and concentrated heat there.
Seriel jumped up and shouted.
“Amy! then no!”
Human heat is hot enough to kill germs, but if it is enough to expel parasites, there is a high probability of death.
‘Even if you defeat Sirone… … .’
The crimson eyes emitted red light as if they were about to explode.
“I’m going to hit it with my will!”
The nape of Amy’s neck bulged and popped open with a worm popping out.

[632] What Really Matters (2)
The slender-legged Pilot Insect landed on the floor, and Amy’s foot crushed it.
“I will not forgive you.”
Whether Sirone helps Maya or not, it’s enough for her to take responsibility for her actions.
The shame of having her emotions exposed and the shame of being manipulated by others’ will aroused Amy’s anger.
‘brand!’
As her body burned like dry firewood, Ifrit, the spirit of flame, appeared.
However, the place he rushed to was, contrary to everyone’s expectations, Shirone.
‘Sirone… … ! Be kind and get lost!’
Ifrit’s fists swung around in a frenzy, and afterimages of the flames roamed through the flames.
When everyone was watching in an unexpected situation, Amy’s hand grabbed Sirone’s collar.
“I’ll see you after the test.”
Sirone raised a corner of her mouth, and Amy spun and tossed him at Fishaw.
“Sheesh!”
Fisho lifted Argones, but a second from the future, the photon cannon was already blazing in the abdomen.
“Gagging!”
If it were real, there would be no shock even though the body would be crushed, but 2,000 anti-magic was not physical force.
‘Okay, let’s send one person!’
Atomic Bomb caused a series of explosions on Fisho in Groggy state.
– Participation number 24. 2,000 broke away from the system.
There are now 13 survivors.
It was Sirone and his friends who eliminated Fisho with a surprise pincer attack, but Sirone was the most suitable opponent for the next eliminated.
“ha. ha.”
If it wasn’t for the tension of the graduation exam, Sirone’s mental strength was so low that she would have already been exhausted.
“Wizard… … .”
No voice came out.
‘It will work.’
As the contestants’ magic focused on Sirone, the percentage figure eventually fell below 1 percent.
‘I’m sorry, Sirone.’
Maya desperately stood up.
“Taha!”
Cayden was still guarding her side, but only Sirone could see in her eyes.
‘It’s because of me. Because I’m weak… … .’
If he hadn’t saved himself from the anthill, he wouldn’t have faced the danger of being eliminated.
‘But that’s because it’s Sirone.’
Among mages ruled by coolness, he was the only one who showed sincerity to himself.
‘Because it will never change.’
Maya’s eyes were moist.
“I love you so much.”
Eating out – only for this moment.
When her song started, the participants forcibly stopped and the VIP seats were buzzing.
“Magic power level, 120 million magicles.”
“what?”
‘Only for this moment’ was the song Maya sang when she went on stage for the first and last time.
‘It’s out of the norm.’
Participants who realized that their concentration was forcibly released felt the seriousness of the situation and rolled their eyes here and there.
‘My mental strength is recovering.’
On the other hand, Sirone’s spirit was making a huge rise.
‘Accept my song, Sirone.’
There is an extreme risk that she can only be summoned once in her lifetime, but the fact that she shows concentration of 120 million magical powers was only due to her genius.
‘It’s a great skill.’
As a court musician, Reina has heard many voices, but the voice she hears now has a resonance that cannot be analyzed with technology.
“Maya… … .”
Tears welled up in the chieftain’s eyes.
At the age of 12, she had the opportunity to perform at the opening stage for singer Canary.
Even back then, her singing skills enthralled the audience, but all she got back was booing.
‘It must have been a mask that was too good.’
Canary’s popularity was so great that they had fans in other countries, so the 12-year-old’s song on the opening stage could not be accepted with his heart.
Maya, who made the performance the worst, did not get a second chance, and the moment she heard that only perverted aristocrats’ sponsorships came in, she gave up being a singer.
“Only- this moment.”
Even the contestants who struggled at first had to admit that they had to listen to her now.
‘It seems that all the hairs on my head stand on end.’
Collie trembled, clutching her hair with both hands.
‘Who says this girl is weak.’
It was he who was fascinated by twelve-year-old Maya on stage and brought her to magic school.
‘I’m not calling you because I want to look great. It’s not like I practice every day to get an evaluation.’
That’s why it wasn’t the best, it was sincere.
Looking up at the world from the lowest position, sincerity that can only be sublimated with that pain.
‘If you think there is such a thing, everything is beautiful… … .’
Criticize, analyze, compare and rank.
‘Do we rank our emotions?’
If that is not possible, there is no superiority or inferiority in Maya’s song.
“Only- this moment!”
As the song reached its climax, the spirits of the participants shook like waves as the intense emotion surged in.
“Sirone’s percentage numbers are going up, while everyone else’s numbers are going down.”
“It’s not about stealing. It is the ability to strike a balance.”
In theory, it was an emotional equalization created through the resonance of the voice.
“Huh!”
As Maya’s clear high-pitched voice pierced the sky, Sabina fainted, unable to overcome the emotional tension.
‘Two people ahead!’
In a situation where the final 10 people would be decided if only two people were eliminated, Pony bit her lip until it bleeds.
‘I can’t do this! Why is no one collapsing!’
At that time, the desperate pleasure created by the frustration of the participants reaches its climax through the fall of the royal family.
“Huh!”
Pony’s knees bent and fell to the ground.
‘I did my best… … .’
what was lacking?
Without finding an answer to that question, she hit her forehead on the ground like the other dropouts.
‘There is only one person now.’
While the will of the contestants was burning even more, only Kayden was smiling sadly.
‘I love you, Maya.’
Looking at Maya, who only looked at Sirone, Kayden said goodbye.
‘But I don’t think I can go with you.’
When this song ends, Maya will eventually burn out, but a completely different future awaits from Caden’s exhaustion.
‘I hope you’re happy. I mean it.’
The crosssword fell with a trembling sound, and Cayden closed his eyes and accepted the song with all his heart.
not a technology
That’s why prejudice disappears the moment you just accept it, and her song is not magical, but touching and wets your heart.
‘My muse… … .’
At the same time as Caden collapsed without a sound, a 100% pure voice with no foreign body sounded through the sky.
“Leave-I-Go-yo.”
A shudder ran down the spine of everyone gathered in the Colosseum.
‘He’s a genius. I don’t even need to verify that.’
Reina looked at Maya with a look of astonishment.
Impressing everyone at the gathering of scouts from all over the world predicted that her tomorrow would be 180 degrees different from today.
‘It’s over.’
Maya took a slow breath and raised her head to face Sirone.
“Thank you so much, Sirone.”
Sirone couldn’t say anything, just bowed his head in the most reverent way.
It was a song that she sang for only one person, who now had only to become the most famous in the world.
“hi… … .”
At the same time as Maya, who closed her eyes, collapsed, the participants regained their freedom as the regulation eating out was solved.
Faced with reality, their heads spun quickly.
‘Wait a minute, then what’s going on with this?’
– Entry No. 26. 2,000 broke away from the system. The final 10 people have been decided.
The 2,000 number information system continued to broadcast.
– Mystery Maya. Graduation Final Ranking 10th confirmed. There are 9 participants left.
“Wowaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
The audience stood up at the same time and gave a standing ovation.
It was applause for the final 10 people who succeeded in graduating, but the praise was greater for Maya, who overcame adversity and finally received the qualification of a wizard.
“Chief! Sister, sister… … !”
While Maya’s younger siblings couldn’t speak, the chief also secretly stole tears.
‘Great job! Really great, Maya!’
Elizabeth asked amid praises pouring down on Maya, who beautifully decorated the final gateway to graduation.
“Mystery Maya. Please give me your final evaluation.”
Starting from 10th place, it was polite to be called by name, not by number, because they were officially registered graduates who were actually scouted.
“F. I’m too far behind in everything to be a mage.”
As if she had already expected it, when Lara licked her lips and wrote it down, Baikal unusually added a supplementary explanation.
“But if I get a chance to go to her concert someday, I’d really like to reserve the S seat.”
The applause that filled the Coliseum showed no sign of stopping, and the remaining participants felt their legs unravel.
‘Pass, pass.’
Whatever it was, the feeling of having graduated was thrilling enough to be replaced by anything in the world.
‘really… … Did I graduate?’
Amy felt at the same time a sense of exhilaration that everything seemed unreal and a sense of relief that the world was about to collapse.
But that was for a moment, and he hurriedly tightened his eyes and shook his head.
‘Calm down. It’s not over yet.’
The moment you are satisfied, you become a human being whose limit is that far.
Looking around, the other participants were also converging toward the center of the Colosseum, looking unfinished.
“First, congratulations… … .”
Dante lifted his chin and said.
“Still, the best should be covered, right?”
As if it was a promise, everyone’s eyes focused on one person, and Sirone also smiled and relaxed.
“However much.”
With Maya’s eating out, the mental powers of the participants were leveled.
That’s why it was a new evaluation, and it was the beginning of a real sword game where you no longer have to worry about being eliminated.
“Ooooooh!”
Then the audience started booing.
Unlike the contestants who pledged to fight in the center, the voice was directed at Nade, who was still standing in the corner.
“coward! What a wizard you are!”
“Where in the world is there a wizard who is lucky enough to pass the exam! I’d rather give it to another contestant!”
Sirone was the one who stood out the most, but the other contestants also fought desperately in their respective positions and got their hands on the pass.
On the other hand, Nade did not show any wizard-like abilities in the first evaluation, and even reached this position with a ridiculous chance of never colliding with anyone in the second evaluation.
It was only natural that the audience, already moved by Maya’s acceptance, would be displeased with his inclusion in the final scene.
“Nade is not a coward.”
Liz, who was observing as a graduate of Alpheas Magic School, looked at Nade with a pitiful expression.
“just… … You lost your way.”
It was all the more regrettable because she was the only one who had erased the path left to Nade.
“If you give me one more chance.”
Holding hands, Liz earnestly prayed that Nade would not let go of hope one last time.
“West Nade. I haven’t shown anything special enough to judge yet. No battles either. No one bothered to deal with him.”
Lara agreed with Elizabeth’s words.
“Luck is also skill. But in this case, it’s pretty extreme luck. Have you ever been like this?”
“It is not possible.”
“yes?”
Baikal said with a serious expression.
“There is no chance of coming up to the final ranking fight avoiding a collision. Therefore, it is correct to assume that Nade did not run away, but that everyone ran away from Nade.”
“but… … It didn’t look particularly good.”
“That’s why you get booed. I don’t know. What were those who were not even willing to die afraid of?”
For wizards, it is more fearful than death.
“Circumstances beyond our control.”
Realizing something, Baikal raised his head.
“A variable enough to destroy the system, what they feared was complete chaos.”

[633] What Really Matters (3)
Amid endless accusations, participants looked back at Nade, who was still unwilling to fight.
‘I knew it would end like this.’
Frings clearly remembered the horror he suffered from Nade in Scramble Royale.
He was also not a normal personality, so he robbed and woke up shortly after, but it was an incident that he did not want to experience again.
‘It’s definitely a ticking time bomb that’s not good to touch.’
But now, the final 10 players were confirmed, and if there was nothing to lose anyway, it was advantageous for the scouts to evaluate them.
“Come on. There’s nowhere else to run, right?”
Frings wiggled his hands and provoked, but Nade just stared at the sky helplessly.
‘I’m graduating?’
Anyway, does it make any sense?
Even if you graduate like this, there will be no institution that will call you who have not done anything.
Just as public and non-officials are different, even the same wizard is treated differently according to society’s recognition.
If she is eliminated as it is, her initial plan to disappoint her mother will properly succeed.
“I will not fight.”
Fighting with Sirone was unimaginable.
“That’s ridiculous.”
Dante had never seen Nade’s true face, but he was unaware of the atmosphere that some talented people shun.
“Should we accept it if you say you don’t want to fight?”
“I am not interested in what you think. I don’t fight.”
Anhamuin’s answer raised the voices of the audience.
“A coward like that doesn’t deserve to be a wizard!”
“Hey, just step on it! Jailbreak!”
The reason why it did not move despite the audience’s torch was because it was not as simple as it sounds.
Iruki took a step towards Nade.
“How about dropping out? It’s a meaningless fight for you.”
He remembered the promise Nade had made the day before the graduation exam.
At least if he eliminated me now, I wouldn’t become an enemy, though unpleasant memories would remain.
“… … .”
When Ned didn’t say anything, Iruki pointed at him with his index finger.
“Look, you want to fight too. You don’t want to drop out, do you?”
‘mother.’
Although the seats were packed with people, it was easy to find Teria.
The face, though not noble, was still beautiful, distorted like a demon among hundreds of faces, and was pressing on Nade.
‘A terribly disgusting face.’
Even so, as a child, he has no choice but to love his face.
“go away! Wizard’s Shame! Don’t lower the dignity of the school!”
Teria’s face turned red at the people’s criticism.
“I’m going to be embarrassed. What kind of ugliness is that?”
The Ballroom Pushed The Wife
“stop it. You should cheer me on too.”
“Look at the other students. Everyone fights hard to make their parents happy. How can you be so selfish?”
Lichen approached Nade from behind.
“Annoying. Just die.”
Grabbing Nade by the neck, he threw it to the end of the Colosseum with a lightning strike.
Then, the electric shock gathered in front of me flew in a huge parabolic arc and hit the spot where Ned had fallen.
‘You fool! Electricity… … !’
Frings’s face turned pale, and everyone who knew magic fairy tales looked at Nade in a rigid posture.
“what?”
However, Nade was just looking at Teria with a sad look.
It was three days later that the Gasols came to rescue Nade, who could not stand the torture of the Chicken Head bandits and whose mind had been destroyed.
Among the bodies burned like charcoal, young Nade cried like an idiot, and the seizures did not stop even though he spent a lot of money for treatment.
“why are you crying! Why are you crying! Do you know how much damage my mother suffered because of you?”
Her heart burns for spending the most money borrowed from relatives on her son’s treatment.
“Mom, Mom… … .”
Nade desperately endured.
Even more terrifying than the inner monster was the mother’s pain, and gradually the convulsions began to subside after the hiccups.
‘I am… … What did I do wrong?’
I once got angry.
“It’s not like I wanted to be like this! What the hell have you done to me!”
Ballroom threw the bottle at Nade.
“It’s like a Holo child!”
Perhaps he was annoyed at the child getting on his fearful wife’s nerves, but Nade felt nothing but resentment.
“Aaaaaaa!”
That moment when Nade rushes into the wall and bangs his head to destroy the body they inherited.
“Aaaaaagh!”
Teria scratched her face with her nails.
“honey!”
The ballroom ran in fright, and Nade stared blankly at his mother’s bloody face.
and… … .
“Kill! Rather kill me!”
Teria cut her wrists with a knife without hesitation.
“damn! anyone quickly! Call the doctor!”
“Um, Mom… … .”
While all the family members were busy moving, only Nade was watching her as if time had stopped.
“sorry… … .”
Nade whimpered with a foolish face.
‘Don’t be angry. I was wrong.’
There is no child in this world who overcomes their parents.
“It is irreversible. It’s completely over.”
As Nade writhed, the remaining eight contestants ignored him and collided in the center of the Colosseum.
While everyone was mesmerized by the splendid magic feast, only Nade and Teria were exchanging glances.
“I can’t look at you because I’m pathetic.”
When Teria got up from the audience and turned around, Ned’s fists clenched violently.
‘Yes, go away. I will never be a wizard! I will never give you the life you want!’
It was a situation I wanted so much.
But why is it so painful?
Why do I fall into the abyss without limit?
‘We’re going to perish together! All we have to do is die together!’
The moment Teria disappears beyond the shadow of the exit.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
Nade screamed and stood up.
“What the hell am I!”
Electricity radiates throughout the body.
“What did you do so wrong eh eh!”
At the same time as the speech occurred, Nade flew behind Sirone and swung his arm.
“Ouch!”
As Sirone rolled on the floor at such a speed that they couldn’t even react, the participants turned their heads in surprise.
“Huhhhh!”
There was a creepy look in Ned’s convulsions with his teeth clenched, as if he was about to explode at any moment.
“What is your horsepower level?”
Baikal asked, but Elizabeth blinked without even thinking about answering.
“what’s the matter? Magic power level!”
“… … sorry. Let me check one more time.”
When Nade took a step, everyone took ten steps back.
“why? Why?”
Nade’s doubts were rising from a very deep hatred that could not even be guessed at.
“Why eh eh eh!”
The 2,000 system beeped as lightning shot through the sky over the Colosseum.
-Exceeded data capacity limit. Activate the emergency system. Second core open.
The lights of the Colosseum flickered.
-Exceeded data capacity limit. 3rd core open. 4th core open.
White thunderbolts were erected like pillars and sprinted across the floor, then dispersed into hundreds and wandered about in a dizzying manner.
“Is the 4th core open?”
As far as Baikal knows, it was unprecedented in history.
– Activate the final stabilization device. 5th core open.
Only after all 5 emergency systems were activated, the 2,000th worked normally, and the same blue light came on in the eyes of the analysts.
“How many?”
“… … It is 1.48 billion magicle.”
Baikal’s head turned as if it were about to break.
“1.48 billion? Is that a possible figure?”
“the problem is… … .”
Elizabeth continued in a trembling voice.
“It is still going up.”
Iruki, who was looking at the fallen Shirone, frowned as if he didn’t like it and said.
“What happened to your promise to me? You said you wouldn’t fight with Sirone, so you stabbed me in the back like this?”
“are you okay.”
Sirone slowly stood up.
“Because this is a test. He didn’t mean to kill me.”
Iruki wanted to believe that too, but the only thing left for Nade, who was in a magical assimilation state, was a purposeless murderous intent.
“Big!”
Sirone looked at Nade’s grotesquely distorted face and said with a sad smile.
“At first I thought it was a scary face.”
He is so soft-hearted and kind that he cannot even get angry without hating someone.
“Actually, it was a painful face, Nade.”
That’s why you can’t destroy anything without first destroying yourself.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
“The final magical power figure is 1.86 billion Magical! It’s a magical fairy tale! If we leave it like this, we will die!”
“Perfect chaos indeed. You must have been afraid of this.”
The state of Nade, who had no reason left, was so violent that it was on a completely different level from what Sirone had experienced before.
Kururrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!
The pale, pure white lightning spread around Nade and became huge enough to encroach on the entire Colosseum.
“Cheak!”
Like a flying insect that touches an electric barbed wire, the moment it touches the white light, the fjord vomits up a agony and collapses.
“Mmmmm!”
All the participants clung to the wall, waiting for the power to subside, and the audience was mesmerized by the sudden power of Nade.
“What is that? Isn’t it more serious than Inpercus?”
What was absurd was Teria as well.
Occasionally magic assimilation occurred and the warehouse was blown up, but I did not know that it contained such terrible power.
“With me… … It doesn’t matter.”
Teria turns to the exit, but Ballroom grabs her wrist.
“Where? The test is not over yet.”
“Is the exam a problem now? If even the machine goes wrong, you can claim damages from us.”
“Isn’t that all you see? Can’t you feel Nade’s pain?”
“I’d rather just kill him! I don’t want to live like this either!”
Ballroom gritted his teeth and led her to his seat.
“sit down! At least take a good look at your son today!”
Nade’s electric shock, which had been swelling into a sphere, stopped expanding and soared in the form of a pillar.
“Now! Attack!”
As the electric shock disappeared, everyone rushed at Nade and poured magic as if they had promised.
‘shit! Two thousand times!’
In actual combat, it would take damage to the body, but it was like a dream to use up 1.86 billion magicles with anti-magic.
‘Idiots! You can go and kill them.’
Lichen cast spark magic to subdue Nade’s tail and grab his face.
Just as he was about to turn his head completely, sparks flew out and Nade’s figure disappeared, then came out from all directions and punched him.
“Aaaaaaa!”
As the final blow was struck, Lichen’s nose slumped and Nade’s wrist twisted.
“The moment you get caught, you are eliminated. It’s like a god’s lottery.”
Sirone soared into the sky while the reckless lightning, which could not be called a technique, galloped.
“Nade!”
The incarnation of the light angel rose hugely, and as the right arm was lifted, enormous energy gathered in the window.
‘Angel’s Punishment!’
The moment the flash struck at a tremendous speed, Nade’s body disappeared as if it evaporated.
“Did you avoid it?”
Even super-fast projectiles seemed slow to Nade, who had the same nerves as electricity.
‘then… … !’
Scouts raised their eyes in amazement as Sirone’s body, which had activated her Quantum Super Position, increased to hundreds.
Quantum Super Position – 300 Stacks – Incarnation Art – Angel’s Punishment.
“This… … It’s not at the level of the graduation exam.”
300 angels raised their arms in unison and pierced their spears of light at Nade.
————————————–

[634] What Really Matters (4)
300 flashes of light spread out like a net from the incarnation of the light angel overlapping at one coordinate.
It was obviously simultaneous when seen by the human eye, but in reality it was mixed with extreme errors.
Each of the 299 incarnations, excluding Sirone, who opened the Force Dimension, threw spears at different times, and Nade, who cast spark magic, repeated birth and extinction among the flashes of light.
While the 87 spears stuck in the ground were gradually losing their light, 93 spears were descending from the sky, and the light angel was wielding the spear of light in an extremely fragmented time.
85, 73, 49… … .
The eyelids of the people who blinked right after the angelic punishment started bombardment were still not even 1/10 closed.
In the distance between the spear that had just arrived on the ground and the spear that was still in the light angel’s hand, Nade realized in the realm of pure signals.
The fact that as the punishment of the angels continued, the time period of the light angels was extremely narrowing the possibility of avoiding them.
Three, two, one.
At the same time as avoiding the last two hundred and ninety-ninth spear, Nade’s possibility was tied to Movement Zero.
The light angel of Sirone, who had canceled the force dimension, pierced the spear for the 300th time to the ground.
Of course, Nade was still standing at the center of the vast space.
However, it was only the final destination of an incident that had already passed through all the points.
And the window of light penetrated.
“Quaaaaaaaa!”
Ned, who was struck by one of the 300 spears that seemed to have been scattered in all directions, straightened his upper body and let out a scream.
The audience simply admired the gigantic feast of light, not even guessing the confrontation between time and electricity that unfolded in the vast expanse of the sea.
“It hit!”
When the flash that penetrated Nade’s body disappeared, all the remaining participants concentrated their firepower.
“Take it down!”
Richard’s magic crystal spewed out flames with maximum power, and Iruki’s Nuclear Fusion created a huge explosion.
In the spot where Frings’ ice wave swept away, Amy’s Inferno fell in a parabolic arc.
It was a firepower worthy of the final chapter of the graduation exam, but the percentage of Nade floating on the analyst’s retina was falling so slowly that it was difficult to confirm without looking closely.
“It’s no use. Anti-magic doesn’t even go into teeth.”
“The fact that the 2,000 times system is too good is also a problem.”
Baikal also thought that in this case, it might have been better if the system went down.
“Kuaaaaa!”
Plasma spread around Nade, and a white light like a scratch spread out.
“You crazy child!”
With Nade at the center, the remaining 6 people scattered in all directions.
puck! Nade appeared in front of Frings as the air burned.
‘Avoid… … !’
My body moves faster than I thought.
‘… … do!’
Nade’s fingertips brushed her skin.
– Druze Springs. 7th place finalized for graduation. There are 6 remaining participants.
‘Does it mean death just by brushing?’
Starting with the final 10 players, the key was to hold out as long as possible because the feeling itself would change with a difference in rank.
“It will be a solid standard.”
Elizabeth asked.
“You mean the criteria for the final ranking?”
“no. It’s too extravagant a criterion to use for ranking.”
“then?”
“It’s not about being number one in the kingdom.”
Baikal felt the joy of being a scout.
“It’s going to be number one throughout the kingdom’s history.”
In the midst of complete chaos, the scout’s attention was focused on who could hold out against Nade, who was close to Mother Nature.
‘You can avoid it! I can fight more!’
After spitting out flames from his left leg, Richard flew up into the sky and looked down at Nade.
Nade disappeared at the same time that the cybernetic circuit predicts the movement and the ice magic bullet fires sharp ice bullets continuously.
-warning! out of frame!
As it disappeared faster than the moment captured by the lens capable of producing one hundred and twenty shots per second, Richard gritted his teeth and activated the propulsion of his left foot.
“shit!”
Nade’s fingertips that appeared from the sky narrowly missed Richard, but he didn’t avoid seeing them anyway.
“Huh!”
Before I knew it, Nade was attacking Amy, and the next moment, he appeared in front of Iruki, Dante, and Sirone.
“Is nature fair?”
Without any calculations, only the will to annihilate the enemies caught in the electric field remained.
‘I’m going to get hurt like this!’
After activating Pascal, Dante transformed all three-dimensional cubes into space movement magic circles.
‘What a monster!’
When Nade rushed at Dante and entered the space movement magic circle, a thick bundle of electricity occupied all the movement coordinates and burned with light.
“Big!”
Just as Dante was gripping the amount of information enough to break Pascal, Nade escaped the magic circle and rushed towards Amy.
‘Swallowing evolution!’
When I went through my consciousness again in samadhi-gyeong, the world became clear as if my skin had been peeled off as the sensitivity that seemed to be able to count even the number of downy hairs enveloped my whole body.
“Aww!”
A lightning bolt barely passed the tip of her nose, and Nade disappeared immediately.
‘Don’t come to me!’
While everyone was thinking the same thing, Ned was run over by Sirone.
‘Sirone is eliminated… … !’
As he lifted his upper body after activating the flame blast, Ned detoured and aimed at Richard.
‘I can’t do it! Shit!’
-warning! out of frame!
While Richard was retreating with the power of the jet, Nade’s face suddenly came in front of him.
‘what? I’m flying at great speed right now?’
Why is Nade always in front?
The fist was captured in the last shot of a frame that shoots 100 or 20 shots per second.
The next moment, the whole world spun, and Richard’s mechanism went out.
– Ainka Richards. 6th place in final ranking for graduation. There are 5 remaining participants.
Being in the final 5 was a different feeling from entering the final 10.
‘From now on, I’m at the top.’
The four people dealing with Nade developed a ranking fight while avoiding the transcendent electric shock.
‘Is it me this time?’
As Nade rushed past Sirone, Iruki’s eyes shot with electricity.
‘Overdrive!’
The Servant’s brain was analyzing all of Nade’s possibilities, but even so, it was tight to meet the time.
“Keugh!”
Nade passed by Iruki, who hurriedly threw herself away, swinging her nails.
‘damn! Can’t stand it for long?’
At that moment, Ned stepped on the ground and stopped, then charged at Iruki again.
‘Why is it only me twice!’
It was an unfair situation to the point where I felt that I had to ask after the exam.
“Oh, really!”
Nade’s electric shock passed over the face of Iruki, who was lying flat.
‘I’ll see you later.’
As Iruki hurriedly raised his upper body, he saw Dante’s serial magic circle, the white sword, aimed at him.
“Nade is not the only enemy.”
“Damn it… … !”
Iruki, who stabbed the spirit zone into Dante’s Pascal, tried to cancel it, but the password was still like an iron wall.
‘I can’t make it on time!’
The moment the flames were mounted in front of the white sword, the albino said.
“Don’t think about it.”
The moment the flame amplified while penetrating the tunnel of the magic circle was about to pass through the muzzle.
“what?”
Cancellation disbanded Pascal.
“You are not a machine, Iruki.”
100 percent is the safest number in the world, but it is not the most efficient number.
“A 50% chance is enough for a human to do something. Believe in yourself, not in probability, in the life given to you.”
It wasn’t a hit, it wasn’t a perfect calculation.
However, at the point where he thought he was ready in a certain probability, he bet on the game, and at that point, Iruki’s future also broke the existing limits and began to expand into infinite possibilities.
‘Intuition? don’t fit… … .’
While Dante was flustered by the unexpected situation, Amy jumped up and swung at Ifrit’s fist.
“Nade and Iruki aren’t the only enemies.”
“Pooh.”
Looking at Amy, Dante blew his hair.
As long as the battery had already been detected, the magic itself was impossible, and the flames struck him, causing the bracelet to light up two thousand times.
– Air servant Dante. 5th place finalized for graduation. There are 4 participants remaining.
‘done! I’m almost there!’
The eyes of Amy, Iruki, and Sirone became more intense than before.
“Kuaaaaa!”
As the number decreased, the number of times he had to deal with Nade increased, but the battlefield of chaos finally began to form a new system as the abilities of Sammae Evolution, Overdrive, and Sibulsang Explosion were fully demonstrated.
‘We’re really crazy! It’s so fast, but no one gets eliminated!’
As the Sammae evolution continued, Amy felt the pain as if thousands of needles were piercing her body, but that pain was the most powerful weapon for survival.
Nade, who was not able to do it, aimed at Iruki this time, but the overdrive with added intuition was showing a much higher efficiency than before.
‘Unstable.’
It’s not a 100% chance, so it could fall into hell the next moment.
‘But it feels great!’
For the first time, I felt that I was alive, and the detonation equation was calculated at a tremendous speed, knocking on Ned’s body.
‘You have to be right.’
It ended in misfire several times, but once it exploded, the power of the atomic bomb was incomparable to before.
Then, fire strikes and photon cannons flew from the left and right at the same time.
“Nade’s magic power level is currently 1.21 billion magicles. I dropped it a lot.”
“But it still makes no sense.”
Literally, Nade was an impregnable fortress, and after 20 minutes, the fatigue of the three reached its limit.
‘That’s really nasty.
At least, while Shirone evaded in a stable state, the graduation exam went to the survival of Amy and Iruki.
‘I just need to hold on a little longer.’
Anyway, since Iruki wasn’t 100% perfect, the more time passed, the better Amy was.
‘but… … .’
As the senses of Samadhi evolution began to adapt, I felt my alertness diminishing.
‘It can’t end like this.’
A thirsty man digs a well, and Amy tried a last resort.
‘You just have to eliminate Nade!’
Elizabeth took notice of Amy, who destroyed the position and charged.
“You’re betting.”
“It is a good decision. In my opinion, there is no chance if it is not now.”
Amy clenched her fists at Nade, who was approaching like a ghost as she cast spark magic in succession.
No matter how great magic is, schema is powerful because the body that casts the magic is human after all.
‘The moment they attack me is an opportunity!’
Even so, in order to hit Nade, who evaded the moment he touched his body, it was necessary to capture the moment of the counter and the counter of the counter.
‘Remember the self-image!’
Nade comes close to Amy, swinging her fingernails.
“Keugh!”
Amy, whose red eyes flashed at the fastest speed ever, twisted her waist and swung her fist.
‘I’m retired. Is it to find life beyond death?’
While Baikal holds its breath and watches.
‘This is the end, you bastard!’
Amy’s fist hit Nade’s chin squarely.
—————————————

[635] Last Gate (1)
The moment Nade’s chin caught in his fist, Amy had a hunch.
‘It went in properly!’
Even in that short moment, as he twisted his back with all his strength, Ned’s head turned and his body spun.
“Great!”
As much as Nade opened up his lifelong rage, Amy’s fist contained the determination to kill, which implied countless hours.
“The magic power level… … !”
The percentage floating in Elizabeth’s retinas decreased as quickly as water was drained with an eyedropper.
It was a speed that gave goosebumps when you recall that it was 1.2 billion Magicles.
When the percentage figure fell below 3 percent, I thought it was really over.
“Aaaaaaa!”
But Nade did not lose consciousness.
Baikal, who guessed the reason, showed emotion for the first time and slammed his knee with a sad expression.
“Reaction Rates of Electricity.”
Amy’s blow definitely delivered a shock, but she twisted her body with reflexes that were faster than the speed at which the shock wave was transmitted, canceling out the power.
As Amy took a step forward with her fist raised, electricity surged from Nade’s spinning body.
It was such a wonderful idea and seeing the light of hope even for a moment, Baikal had no choice but to bite his lip.
‘It was close to perfect. You can be proud of yourself, Amy!’
It was already a counter that transcended human senses, but if only it had gone a little deeper.
If I had been able to push out just 0.1mm more, it would have been the first result of defeating the monster of Magic Fairy Tale.
“Kuaaaaa!”
Amy sighed as she looked at Nade, who screamed and discharged powerful electricity.
‘Calm down, fool.’
At the same time, a massive anti-magic hit his mind.
– Karmis Amy. 4th place in final ranking for graduation. There are 3 remaining participants.
Amy fell forward, and Nade, discharging electricity, collapsed beside her, looking up at the sky.
However, Nade’s mental strength was weakened as well.
“What is your horsepower level?”
“Four million magicles.”
“It has gone down tremendously. It was on the verge of losing consciousness.”
“yes. But even in a state of stupor, having 4 million magicles itself is abnormal.”
Shirone and Iruki, who were gasping for breath in different positions, were thinking the same thing as they looked at the fallen Nade.
‘Just grow up. Please just sleep.’
Then, blue electricity wrapped around Nade’s body.
As consciousness returned, magic fairy tales were in full bloom, and the increase was also bizarre.
“We are breaking through 20 million, 50 million, and 100 million magicles.”
“… … Is something a little strange?”
The lightning that wrapped around Nade soared into the sky and formed the shape of a huge human.
Aaaaaaaang!
The sound waves created by the electricity shook the entire Colosseum, and everyone covered their ears.
“Keugh! what!”
-Everyone die! disappear!
“Is consciousness embodied by magic?”
The electric giant, which expands every time it makes a sound, boasted an overwhelming appearance to the point of being called a thunder god.
-I… … .
The Thunder God crossed his arms and shouted in the loudest voice.
-What did you do so wrong?
A bundle of electricity spread in all directions and began rubbing the end of the 2,000 times area as if a transparent wall had been erected in front of the audience.
“This, this… … !”
The pale spectators couldn’t even blink as they looked at the bluish-white current spreading right in front of them.
Each one of them was Nade’s face, and it had a distorted expression.
-Answer me! Why should I be unhappy? Why do I have to shoulder everything?
Ballroom, who had been looking at Nade’s face shimmering in electric form, turned to his wife.
Ordinary people should be terrified, but Teria was showing the same angry face as Nade.
– Answer me!
As the electric shock was concentrated, Terria shouted as she opened her huge mouth and let out a voice.
“Because I’m pathetic!”
The audience all turned to her.
“honey.”
Ballroom tried to stop her, but death was the only thing that could stop her already enraged.
“What nonsense is this! Mom did her best too! I did everything you asked me to do! They even sent me to a magic school! So you can take the test too!”
-I didn’t wish for my success!
“Stop talking nonsense! Where in the world is there a parent who wants their children to fail! does that suck so much? How could you do this if you pitied her mother!”
The audience whispered at the sudden quarrel between mother and son.
“The West family. I’ve heard that it’s ruined, but it’s really broken.”
“It’s someone else’s family business. Don’t go out of your way, just stay still.”
Teria, who had lost her temper, shouted.
“Do you know how painful it is to live alone? Mom doesn’t want to live either! I’m fed up with supporting you, and your dad is going to die!”
-why… … did you abandon me
It was a small rumble compared to the thunder so far, but Teria was the first to shut up.
“Well, in that situation… … .”
– You didn’t say you were sorry.
“Did I do anything wrong? Because of that too… … .”
– Can you tell me what happened that day?
Teria’s body trembled.
Even though she saw countless burn scars on Nade’s body, she never asked what had happened.
“I don’t want to hear it. It’s already over.”
Electricity flowed like tears from Nade’s face spreading across the transparent wall.
-i think so too. It’s over and there’s no turning back. therefore… … .
The electricity returned to Nade as his face receded.
-Look carefully there, what kind of monster I have become.
Nade, who was limp like a puppet under the shape of the god of thunder, opened his eyes.
“Sirone. Iruki.”
A voice came out of Nade’s mouth, not the thunder god.
“I’m sorry, but I have to win.”
Nade’s face was cold even though he controlled the magical assimilation.
“You said that from the beginning.”
Sirone and Iruki were not disappointed.
Be it betrayal or whatever, the graduation exam was something he could accept as long as he judged and made his own conclusions.
“The magic power level is 240 million.”
Although it recorded a higher number than the Ataraxia Juktan system, it was rather human compared to the violence before that.
“The most powerful instinct and a slightly less powerful reason. Which do you think would be the worst to deal with?”
Elizabeth did not feel the need to answer.
Sirone, Iruki, and Nade moved slowly from the center of the Colosseum.
triangular shape.
The perfect balance that no one could act first made the air of the battlefield heavy.
“what? Come to think of it, the final three.”
said Mark.
“Isn’t it the Supernatural Psychic Research Society?”
“Oh, yes. From 1st to 3rd place.”
Teachers also had mixed feelings.
“Ugh, those troublemakers.”
Shiina grumbled as she recalled the atrocities of the three musketeers who had committed all sorts of accidents since their advanced class days.
“There is no way to just skip it until the end.”
“They were very unique kids. They’re geeks, but can we say they’re innocent? There were many times when my head was pounding, but I feel sad when I think of letting go in my arms.”
At Etella’s words, Shiina smiled bitterly.
“… … They are disciples who will never be forgotten for the rest of their lives.”
After circling the huge Colosseum, the three of them established their own strategies.
‘Ataraxia.’
As the colorful magic formations accumulated in front of Sirone’s eyes, the scout’s seats became agitated.
“You’re betting a match right away.”
“Perhaps. If you fight with the future in mind, it’s a composition that will rather be eliminated. I have no choice but to play the strongest hand.”
‘Nuclear Fusion.’
At the same time, Iruki began to raise the detonation equation containing unprecedented power.
The best thing is to eliminate both of them at the same time.
To do so, an explosion was required to take over the entire Colosseum.
‘Watch wisely, see what the son you ruined can do.’
As Nade’s god of thunder compressed into a sphere, it began to emit white thunderbolts.
Graduation exams, wizards, wealth and fame, he intended to destroy everything.
And I will tell Teria.
Everything you could have is gone forever in this moment.
The spectators swallowed their saliva as the globe of lightning floated in the air like a divine object.
“It must be power that cannot be estimated. There will always be those who drop out.”
Iruki glanced sideways at Shirone.
‘It’s ambiguous. Should I explode first?’
However, if that happened, Sirone and Nade’s magic would be concentrated on him.
‘The best thing is Nade attack Sirone and I blow both of them. Then it will be over.’
As soon as he finished thinking, Nade’s thunderbolt split into two.
“anyway.”
Iruki gave a rotten smile.
‘Because being too friendly is also a problem.’
Sirone was also expecting Nade’s response.
‘done. If Nade keeps Iruki in check, I can attack him too. Then avoid Nade’s attack.’
The speed of the lightning that Nade shoots is beyond imagination, but it could have been avoided enough if it was an explosion of fire.
‘The only thing left now is timing.’
Who will move first?
Nade’s temperament twists before he can finish thinking.
‘It’s Nade!’
The moment the remaining two reacted, both thunderbolts flew towards Sirone.
‘Sheesh, it doesn’t move as expected.’
A tactic that pretends to target both at the same time, but actually eliminates Sirone first.
It was the reason why the less strong reason was scary.
‘then… … !’
The huge flash of light that passed through Ataraxia turned toward Iruki while swallowing the thunderbolt, and as expected, Nade, who cast the spark magic, appeared in front of Iruki.
‘Hey, you idiot. don’t i know you Thanks though… … .’
The corners of Iruki’s mouth rose.
‘It was a pleasant school year!’
Nuclear Fusion!
A ruthless explosion occurred from the center of the Colosseum and swept the entire Colosseum.
The albino, guessing the power from the brightness of the light, murmured with a bewildered expression.
“that… … Aren’t you stupid?”
The last method Iruki chose in the psychological warfare of biting and biting was to blow everything away with an explosion that even he could not handle.
‘It must be a human weapon.’
As new explosions continued to form at the center of the explosion, all the scout could see was the sight that filled the inside of the 2,000 barrier.
“If it were real, everyone would be dead.”
As the explosion that seemed to see the sun in front of them disappeared, the eyes of the audience wandered aimlessly over the Colosseum.
As all three of them fell to the ground without even a slight movement, a flurry flowed like a wave.
“What, what happened?”
– Mercodyne Iruki. 3rd place finalized for graduation. There are 2 participants remaining.
Nade staggered to his feet as soon as he heard the 2,000th guide voice.
“You ignorant child.”
Iruki looked up at the sky and said.
“That depends on your point of view. blow it up as you like Because no one says anything here.”
If it weren’t for the magical power level of over 200 million, Nade would also be lying side by side with Iruki.
“… … It will.”
Nade moved away, and Iruki, who had read through the 19 years like a kaleidoscope, smiled contentedly.
“Ah, I feel relieved.”
The audience waited with bated breath, but the 2,000 guiding voices were no longer heard.
“I canceled the explosion with an amplified mass wave. I was thinking of defending and attacking at the same time.”
“Ah, it’s the head.”
The attention of the audience was focused on one place.
“I’ve known for a long time, but… … .”
Sirone, who slowly stood up on the ground, rubbed her shoulders and grumbled.
“You guys really can’t handle it.”

[636] Last Gate (2)
‘You can’t handle it the most!’
Leaving behind the silent clamor of those who had been eliminated, Nade approached Sirone.
“sorry.”
“are you okay. Let’s do our best to fight.”
“no. I don’t mean that.”
The activity of the electricity that wrapped around Nade’s body dropped and it shimmered as if he was sleeping.
It was a strange thing to have perfect control over magic assimilation, and the power exerted there would be beyond imagination.
“You are blessed, Sirone.”
Sirone did not answer.
“I could have done anything I wanted to do. If you fail, no one will criticize you, and all around you will be people cheering you on.”
Nade turned and started walking.
“But do you know? The fact that when you fought fiercely and accumulated the experience of victory one by one, someone was screaming in pain, deprived of even the opportunity to fight fiercely.”
Nade’s steps stopped.
“effort? experience? If you think you’ve done your best, you’re a fool.”
Nade finished his resolve.
“The reason I say this is because if it isn’t now, you might not hear it. If you fight me, you could die.”
As the resentment against the world and the nameless anger grew, the monster in Ned’s heart woke up.
“Give up. This is your final warning. you can’t beat me.”
“okay. I will give up.”
The Colosseum buzzed.
“If it makes your pain go away, if you can be happy, I can give up as much as I want.”
Nade gritted his teeth and lowered his head.
“… … That’s why it’s stupid.”
Nade, who instantly closed the gap with spark magic, reached out his hand in front of Sirone’s eyes.
“I said it had no roots. But you don’t know how beautiful what you have. Are you saying that getting first place in the graduation exam is nothing for the sake of a friend?”
“no. It’s an important test for my life too. Maybe more important than friends. but… … .”
Sirone was sincere.
“Nothing is more important than a friend’s pain.”
‘This is why I didn’t like it.’
This is why he hated fighting Sirone to the death.
When I’m with Sirone, my disgusting jealousy and anger toward the world seem so clear.
“Stop talking nonsense!”
After being hit in the face by Nade, Sirone spun around and fell to the floor.
“You are always like that! If you say that, do you think I’ll be impressed? Do you think the world will turn out the way you want it to!”
“If you put your mind to it, you can do anything!”
Cirone, who was touching the ground with both arms, stood up and shouted.
“So fight as best you can! Don’t let that anger ruin your life!”
“That anger?”
Hearing the sound of his reason being cut, Ned’s body exploded with power and surged into the shape of a thunder god.
“That’s anger!”
Aaaaaaaa!
An electric roar erupted, and the audience covered their ears.
– I will kill them all!
When Nade’s hatred was realized through magic assimilation, Sirone also countered by invoking incarnation.
The moment the thunder god and the light angel that filled the Colosseum collided, all kinds of simulation figures jumped out of the analyst’s mind.
“Similar, but different.”
light and electricity.
The spectators as well as the scouts were mesmerized by the splendid magic battles that projected their own inclinations as they were.
The Thunder God’s hostility was so violent that even the light angels had no choice but to give it a shot, but Liz seemed to hear Nade’s screams contained in the roar.
‘Nade, you must not lose hope.’
The fact that he perfectly controlled magic fairy tales was a genius that was unprecedented in history.
But he doesn’t shine like Sirone.
-Everyone die! Friends, family, humans, everything disappears before my eyes!
“I won’t let you do that!”
Back to the end of the Colosseum, Sirone fixed both feet on the ground and activated Quantum Super Position.
“I will become a wizard!”
300 stacks of photon cannons bombard the Colosseum like a meteor shower.
-Something like a wizard… … !
Nade shed bloody tears and discharged a lightning bolt.
“I am a monsteraaaaaa!”
Tears welled up in Sirone’s eyes the moment he saw Ned’s face as he escaped from the flashing light.
‘No, Nade. You are not a monster.’
Baikal opened his mouth as the audience held their breath at the screams of Nade, who called himself a monster.
“If only I had been properly educated.”
If only I had been given the opportunity to polish my magic to the best of my ability with everyone’s encouragement and support.
“A talent that I would have reached someday after all.”
Who turned Nade into a monster?
‘I’m sorry, Nade.’
Ballroom couldn’t raise his head because everyone around him seemed to be looking at him.
“… … no.”
Teria, on the other hand, still raised her fearful eyes and denied her son’s pain to the end.
“It’s not my fault.”
The shapeless Thunder God projected Nade’s hatred and formed a huge electrical net.
“I always thought you were a bright kid.”
Alpheas smiled bitterly at Olivia’s words.
“It wasn’t like that when I was younger. Well done. It is a miracle that I lived a normal life while embracing magic fairy tales.”
“It’s unfortunate. If only I had known a little earlier… … .”
“no. I want to believe it’s not over.”
Alpheas did not give up.
“A man becomes an adult when it becomes a nuisance to be angry. But youth don’t know compromise. Being angry means you still have a longing in your heart.”
Pure-blooded youth who wants no blemishes in life.
That’s why Nade, who ruined most of his life with hatred, may be more sick now.
– I’m a freak!
Sirone’s mental strength continued to decline just by the movement of His Highness, which filled the Colosseum.
‘Keugh! It’s really amazing magic power!’
– Who can understand my anger!
Captured by bandits, young Nade was left hanging dangling over a pit with thorns, with his hands and feet tied.
With his teeth biting only one rope, his tortured mind was slowly going mad.
Around the time when even the voices of ridicule could not be heard, the half-conscious Nade dreamed of swimming in the open sea.
A terrible nightmare where you can see land in the distance, but no matter how much you struggle with your hands and feet, you can’t move forward at all.
– Nade. Nade.
The nightmares of the time that were trapped in Nade’s unconscious began to be revealed again through the body of the Thunder God.
-Save me, Nade.
Teria rose to the surface like a water ghost and pressed down on Ned’s back.
‘Swim! Come with me, Mom!’
-I don’t want to do anything. so you save me
‘I can’t do it because it’s hard!’
-It’s okay even if you’re having a hard time. Because I have to be happy. Because I feel the best when I’m happy.
“Huh!”
As if he was still biting into the rope, Nade closed his jaw until his molars snapped.
‘I want to live! I want to live too!’
-okay. So keep swimming! save me
‘No more! I’m not going to swim!’
-Then we’ll die together. your life will end
“Aaaaaaa!”
Waiting for his parents not to return, Nade wanted to let go of the rope in his mouth.
really… … I wanted to let go.
“What do you know!”
Sirone will not know.
What kind of pain it is to live the rest of your life without cutting off the rotten roots.
“How could I know!”
As the Thunder God’s electric shock intensified, the anti-magic’s shock wave surged at a tremendous speed.
There was no place to escape.
“Yeah, I don’t know! But don’t give up!”
At the scene where Nade’s life was vividly relayed through the voice of the thunder god, Sirone’s heart felt as if it would break.
“Fight till the end! You have to struggle to the end!”
Nade’s face twisted grotesquely.
‘Don’t talk nonsense!’
why wouldn’t you want to live?
However, even if he fought fiercely, the only thing he could get was Teria’s satisfied smile, and his heart would become more sick.
“I will die! I will destroy everything and die the most painful death!”
will die
Nothing mattered as long as I was able to make them suffer as they took responsibility and fled their lives.
“Still struggling? You don’t know anything about it, tell me to fight more!”
“okay! fight!”
“why! why me! Only I am in pain, why should I!”
As the Thunder God’s electric shock was applied with unprecedented power, Sirone’s mental strength, which boasted great durability, was shaken.
“you idiot! Why don’t you know!”
Even so, they can endure because if they collapse like this, no one will be able to prevent Nade from being destroyed.
“If we don’t fight… … If you don’t even struggle… … .”
Tears flowed from Sirone’s eyes.
“You sink!”
As the unprecedented magic was cast, numerous sirones began to overlap on one coordinate.
Quantum Super Position – Wheel of Fear.
At first it’s 2 stacks.
Sirone, who has expanded the Force Dimension, is the base, and in that state, the newly overlapped Sirone activates Quantum Super Position once again.
Then what will be the result?
Miro, who knew the answer, raised her eyes and shouted.
“it’s crazy! What were you thinking about that!”
Since the events taking place in the Force Dimension are independent, it is impossible to control them even if they feed back the overlap only once.
In other words, it was a cowardly fractal.
‘How are you going to control it?’
Even Sirone herself could not tell how many cases were overlapping.
Some sirones will stop overlapping, but if even one of the thousands makes a different decision, the fractal structure will start again from there.
In the end, it is trapped in the so-called quantum bubble phenomenon, where nothing can be done except superposition.
“Great!”
Under the weight of endlessly overlapping incidents, all sirones lost their activity, but desperately waited for the limit of control.
‘you can do it. It can be integrated.’
As the number of events increases, the variable also increases, and that variable will exponentially increase the number of variables that will occur in the future.
‘Now!’
The moment he reached the limit of a variable he could control over all time, Sirone glared at the world with his eyes wide open.
Ultima System – Elysion.
Miro trembled as the unified Sirone stopped activating Quantum Super Position and raised her head at the same time.
‘There must have been a way like that.’
To others, it looked like a single Sirone, but Miro could clearly feel the terrifying presence inside it.
‘Also, maybe this is Macklein Guffin’s true ability… … .’
Quantum fluctuations.
‘Let’s live! Let’s live, Nade!’
As Sirone flew up into the sky and compressed the photons, a huge sphere of light shook as if a hole had been punched in the sky.
The power of God’s particles raised from the state of cowardice is equivalent to the state reached by Miro, Sammaekyung.
The scouts who encountered the stage of dehumanization lost even the will to analyze and just accepted the huge phenomenon.
‘Ah, my God. Is it like that?’
Alpheas shed tears of emotion.
‘I am… … Are you okay with this?’
The light of the Mirhi family.
The mistakes he made in his youth haunted him for the rest of his life, leaving him with the guilt of betraying his God-given talent.
However, at this moment, the genius who surpassed himself, who had been waiting for so long since the establishment of the magic school, appeared.
‘True light does not go out in darkness. That I, the human being, is nothing more than a tool to shine that light.’
It seemed that God was extending his hand from beyond the curtain of the world turning white.
forgive your sins
After decades of waiting, Alpheas knelt down and raised his head at the confident voice.
‘Ah, that’s why you’re showing me, lord. you made… … .’
best masterpiece.

[637] Last Gate (3)
Even electricity could light up the darkness, but even that was just darkness in front of Sirone’s light.
Nade couldn’t bear the sacredness of embracing the whole world.
The presence of Sirone, which overlapped beyond count, was a kind of fear that Nade felt for the first time in a state of magical assimilation.
As that fear meshed with anger, the magical power level reached a new record again.
“Aaaaaaa!”
The Colosseum’s lights flickered as the system overloaded two thousand times.
Anxiety was further amplified because it was already getting dark, and people with sensitive nerves trembled with fear as they intuited a major accident.
“What a ridiculous graduation exam.”
Nade or Sirone, if it was only one of them, the 2,000 times system made with the best technology in the kingdom would never go down.
But now, both of them were recording figures beyond common sense, and no one could have guessed whether the system would be able to calculate them when they collided.
‘You don’t know, Sirone.’
Sirone, who has no roots from the beginning, does not know what it means to have rotten roots.
That contradictory pain that can’t be cut off and can’t be cut off.
“I don’t know!”
The lightning that spread in all directions came flying like a curve and hit Sirone with concentration.
“Big!”
Dozens of sirones per second were electrocuted and began to collapse.
However, the incident of cowardice bubbled up like a bubble, and supported the limits of fractal forever.
‘Let’s live! I’m going to live, Nade!’
The 2,000th bracelet was on the verge of being destroyed, but he did not hesitate.
Quantum Fluctuation – Photon Cannon.
The shock of air coward was converted into anti-magic just by the rushing mass wave, striking Nade’s brain.
‘My anger won’t go away like this!’
If it was anger that could be turned off in the first place, isn’t your life too miserable, having lived with only that anger?
Magic Fairy Tale – Brain Rebirth.
“Kuaaaaa!”
Without needing to control the ever-soaring mana, Nade just vomited all his power, and the shape of the Thunder God twisted into tens of thousands of strands and stretched out towards Sirone.
-warning! warning! system overload. Two thousand times the system is down. 10 seconds remaining. 9 seconds… … .
“Damn it!”
Amidst the energy of different attributes intersecting, half of the audience jumped up, and even the analysts cut off the main system to prepare for an emergency.
‘Look smart! my anger! My appearance as a monster!’
He seemed to hear the cry in Nade’s heart.
‘Nade, I know how hard it was.’
Anger feeds on people’s hopes and grows, so once you get caught up in it, you don’t know what’s really important.
‘but… … We’re almost there.’
At least Nade didn’t give up.
Relying on the vague light that one day they might be able to fly freely, they were holding on to the rope while waiting for their parents who would never return.
‘Now you have us! therefore… … !’
The quantum fluctuation restored the event lost due to the brain regeneration and increased the flash to the same size as the beginning.
“Let’s live! Nade!”
The moment the flash came down as if nothing was blocking it, Nade opened his mouth in wonder.
“ah… … .”
The holy light began to push away the magic fairy tale’s wrath.
‘Ah, Sirone.’
The bloody tears turned into a clear liquid.
‘you are beautiful.’
so much… … splendid
‘so I… … be friends with you… … .’
A gigantic light flashed and expanded, erasing Nade’s entire face.
After a long silence, everyone in the Colosseum slowly opened their eyes, as if the world had been born for the first time.
The long run of light made me feel as if the process so far was a dream, and the system went down 2,000 times as if it were true.
Of course, the guidance voice was not heard, and people finally came to their senses and looked around the battlefield.
“Me, over there!”
Nade collapsed sprawled in the center of the Colosseum, and Sirone gasps while watching it from a distance.
Realizing that the graduation exams were over, a burning feeling surged in people’s hearts.
“Whoaaaa!”
Everyone shouted and jumped up, and a standing ovation circulated around the Colosseum in waves.
“Sirone! Sirone! Sirone!”
Nade’s name was not heard even once in the chanting that spread throughout the city of Creas.
‘It’s like this… … .’
Even if you shed bloody tears and suffer, even if you cry like a monster because you lived a hard life, no one cares about you.
-Fight till the end! I mean, keep fighting until the end!
Did Sirone know?
Is that why he shouted so earnestly even though he knew of the frustrating situation he couldn’t help?
“Nade.”
Sirone, who was kneeling, raised his head.
We don’t know exactly when the 2,000th system went down, and the impact of Anti-Magic must have been enormous.
“Nade!”
Sirone was unable to stand up due to the loss of strength throughout his body, and approached Ned with his limbs struggling as if he were crawling.
“Sorry… … . I’m sorry, Nade.”
When the accident that was only aimed at the graduation exam was resolved, emotions flooded in.
As he sobbed and burst into tears, Nade’s lungs roared.
“Cheuk, cuck.”
While Sirone made a blank expression, Nade raised his upper body with a self-deprecating face.
“What, did you lose even after doing this?”
Disregarding friends, family, and even his own life, he spewed out everything from Magic Fairy Tales.
I thought that I could destroy anything in the world if I put my mind to it, so the current situation, blocked by the wall called Sirone, was absurd and embarrassing.
“Nade, are you okay?”
Nade looked at Sirone’s weeping face, then looked away.
‘How am I… … .’
It wasn’t that he didn’t even show his bare face without the determination to dig up his business card as a friend.
As the 2,000th system was restarted, a voice guidance was finally heard.
– West Nade. Confirmation of the second place in the final ranking for graduation.
The voices of the audience suddenly disappeared.
-Arian Sirone, the top passer of the Alpheas Magic School Graduation Exam. The data of 30 or more participants is transmitted to the red line.
“Honey, my son… … .”
Vincent and Olina opened their mouths in a daze, exhausted from being surprised any longer.
It was the most intense graduation exam in the kingdom’s history, so it took a long time for the audience to be filled with emotions.
“Rian, did you hear? did you just hear?”
Reina, who was tapping her brother’s shoulder, felt an unusual energy and turned her head to see Lian shaking with clenched fists.
was a little boy
He was nasty enough to tell him sternly when he hid in the library to avoid swordsman Kite, excellent enough to succeed in swordsmanship with a wooden sword he had never held before, and strong enough to defeat himself in a real sword match.
– Take responsibility for what you are responsible for.
Could anything more accurately describe his character than these words?
-But you don’t have to take responsibility for things you shouldn’t be responsible for.
I have no regrets about what my heart chose.
-Even if I die, I don’t regret being friends with you.
Because that boy is Sirone.
“Sirone eh!”
Ryan shouted with all his might.
“Let’s go! to the world!”
At the signal that Lian’s voice echoed throughout the Colosseum, the entire audience stood up and applauded.
“The best! It is the pride of Tormia Kingdom!”
“You will definitely become a great wizard!”
It was so loud that you couldn’t even hear the voices right next to you, and Miro and Poltar, who had embraced each other for the first time, jumped up and down, forgetting their embarrassment.
“Kyaaak! I’m the chief! Sirone is the chief!”
“I told you! I knew you could do it! After all, my eyes were not wrong! Oh wait!”
Foltar, who was delighted with his work, rummaged through his bag and hurriedly wrote down his impressions in a notebook.
On the other hand, Miro’s face became a bit sad as he looked at Sirone, who shyly greeted her as if she wasn’t used to praise.
‘I’m ready.’
Twenty-thousand times doesn’t mean you can fight more leisurely than real battles, but the gap between virtual and reality certainly existed.
If all the magic that appeared in the graduation exam had collided in reality, the result would have been different from today.
However, since everyone has fought at the same opportunity, it is also true that there is no more proven method than this, and the reason Miro is sad is precisely at this point.
‘Sirone, as of today, you have become the best student in the kingdom. But that’s why I have to take on more responsibility.’
The world Sirone had to fight in was a real mayhem that was so cruel that it could not be compared to the graduation exam.
‘congratulations. And I’m sorry.’
As one of the people who raised Sirone, he had already drawn what he would have to go through in the future.
‘It will be hell. You won’t want to endure it. You will shed bloody tears, Sirone.’
Even without mentioning the duty of the strong, humanity will eventually stand at the crossroads of destruction, and Sirone, as a member of the whole, must lead everyone.
‘So do your best to enjoy today. It’s your day.’
Just then, when Miro turned around with a smile on his eyes, a bald middle-aged man approached.
“Here you are, Miro. I couldn’t recognize him because he was wearing a hood.”
It was Fermi’s father, Enrique.
“Oh, but you still came as a son?”
“Because the atmosphere was a little different this time. But it fell.”
“I’m sorry. Have you met Fermi?”
“I left without saying anything. I wonder if I will try again next year, maybe even quit school.”
Fermi was also a power that Miro couldn’t throw away.
“don’t worry. He’s a kid who never makes a judgment call. Although that’s even more nasty.”
If it was Olga’s son, there would be no problem if he trusted him.
“Hmm, Mirora. where did you hear… … ! What, a maze!”
Foltar shouted, his eyes wide open.
I don’t know anything about the 20 referees, but I couldn’t forget her name, which was reputed to be the world’s best talent.
Foltar, feeling the cognitive dissonance at the sight of Miro inflating her cheeks and bringing her index finger to her, was trembling, but she wrapped her arms around her shoulder.
“I’m in the worst mood, so let’s go get a drink. Of course, as long as the uncle lives.”
“… … Are you really a maze? You don’t look like you’ve aged at all, what the hell have you been doing all this time?”
“Ho-ho-ho! Would you be shocked to hear the story? Enrique, what are you doing? let’s go.”
Enrique, who shook his head and followed him, asked.
“By the way, are you not going to meet Sirone?”
“yes I’m fine.”
Miro looked back as he walked toward the exit of the Colosseum.
“Because we will meet at a higher place.”
Amid endless applause, Sirone held out his hand to Nade.
“Nade, can you stand up?”
Nade chuckled and turned his head.
“it’s okay. don’t think of me as a friend You don’t even deserve it.”
“That said… … .”
That moment when Sirone was about to say something while furrowing her brow.
“you! You’ll have to speak up!”
Iruki ran over and punched Nade in the head.
“ah! Why do you hit me!”
Iruki’s finger came in front of Nade’s eyes as he turned his head.
“Why are you attacking me twice! Is that on purpose?”
Nade, who blinked for a moment, frowned.
“I don’t know! Your face must have called a fist! I’m not in a good mood, but I’m interfering.”
Iruki narrowed her eyes.
“What’s wrong with you? He said he was not interested, but even took the next seat.”
Thinking that he should stop talking, Nade looked back at Sirone.
“Anyway, don’t forgive me. I will be leaving The Three Musketeers from today.”
This time, Sirone hit her head.
“ah! Why, really!”
“Because it’s frustrating! Not fighting is not a friend! Friends are the ones who can fight and reconcile! Don’t you have that much trust?”
Nade, who was staring at me with gritted teeth, lowered his head with a sad expression.
“It’s just that I can’t forgive myself. I don’t know why.”
“It’s important to take life seriously, but… … .”
Iruki put his hand on Nade’s shoulder.
“You don’t have to live seriously, do you? All well done. Just shake it off and leave.”
Do you really deserve it?
At the time of questioning, Sirone held out her hand again and smiled.
“Let’s go eat, Nade.”

[638] People leaving (1)
The administrator broadcasted on a business trip, but many people who had the afterglow of the graduation exam still couldn’t leave.
Baikal was also collecting the voices of scouts from other countries while maintaining its position.
As expected, the name that came out the most on their lips was Sirone, and Elizabeth was proud of that.
“It is worth coming to Alpheas Magic School. I don’t know how the exams have been in other areas, but it probably won’t get as much attention as here.”
Now the scouts’ job is to write a report.
A detailed evaluation of all 30 people will be written, and after classification according to rank, submit it to the association, and the royal castle’s Ministry of Magic will set the terms of the contract and enter into full-scale negotiations.
“Sirone must be caught. Scouts from other countries have already taken action. You will be preparing a huge down payment and options.”
“We still have a chance. According to the red line agreement, the Ministry of Magic in the country has priority in negotiating for students produced by their country’s schools.”
Even if it was an international student from another country, it was the same.
“It won’t be easy to convince Sirone. You have definitely put your skills into practice. If the negotiating veto is invoked and announced on the red line, contract terms will be raised competitively in countries around the world. He has no reason to accept it.”
“… … I calculated this from the beginning and went to the graduation exam. Now the position has been reversed.”
Lara said.
“We need to drastically raise the terms of the kingdom’s highest contract, not just renew it. If you think that offers will come from the Empire, you will never lose money.”
Elizabeth agreed.
“If it’s reasonable, Sirone wouldn’t want to leave Tormia. After all, it’s where I’ve lived my whole life.”
It is not easy to leave a place with a history of life.
“That reasonable level is the problem. Breakthroughs are also established based on experience. The current kingdom’s highest annual salary is 24 million gold, which was signed 10 years ago. Aside from the extra benefits and options, there was a lot of talk among the nobility. After all, I was just a graduate without an official license.”
If it was 24 million gold, it was an amount that an unofficial wizard with average economic activities in Tormia’s mercenary guild could not earn even if he worked for 10,000 years.
It was an income gap that was unconvincing even considering the enormous value magic created.
It was the uniqueness of the magic field created by the exclusivity of the manpower base where no alternative industry could exist, the problems directly related to national defense, and the competitive spirit of countries around the world integrated into the red line network.
In fact, it was a common sentiment in each country to want to hold on to a world-famous wizard, even if it cost billions of gold a year.
“However, the party to the contract easily passed the official certification and is now the commander of the kingdom’s guard magic unit. If it’s enough to renew the highest contract, public recognition is not a problem.”
“Then how much do you offer? 1 million? 10 billion? Empire can pay. It’s not because Sirone’s magic is 100 or 1,000 times stronger. It’s because it’s a magic that only Sirone can do. If you beat them with money, the kingdom is no match.”
Veteran Baikal’s prediction is probably correct.
“First of all, you will have to offer more than money in the negotiations. Since he said he was a commoner, giving him a noble title is one way. But I’m skeptical that the Ministry of Magic will do that.”
“Why? Of course you have to catch Sirone, don’t you?”
“I think so because we are mages and scouts. There are many things to think about in various ways, such as the resistance of nobles and the elimination of royal ponies. It’s politics from now on.”
Baikal’s wrinkles deepened.
“And politics always betrays individual common sense.”
* * *
Participants who took a break in the waiting room left the Colosseum only after the audience had left their seats.
The audience, who had not yet left school, applauded from afar, and numerous parents looked around in search of their children.
“mom!”
Sirone found Olina and Vincent standing with the Ogent family and ran to them.
“Sirone!”
Of course, Olina was the first to hug her, and she wept profusely as she buried her face in her now grown-up son’s chest.
“Was it hard? Are you not hurt anywhere?”
Even after crossing the huge mountain of passing the graduation exam, Sirone’s simple nature of taking care of her child’s health first brought tears to her eyes.
“It’s okay, Mom. sorry.”
I didn’t want to show a fierce fight.
“Good job. You really worked hard, Sirone.”
Lian and Raina watched with delighted expressions as Vincent hugged his son and wife at the same time.
Amy’s mother, Isis, pointed to the Colosseum as other participants were also reunited with their parents.
“Here is Amy.”
I couldn’t read the emotions on the face that seemed lost in thought or dazed.
“Amy, here you are.”
Hearing Isis’ voice, Amy suddenly came to her senses and approached with her head bowed.
4th place in the final graduation ranking.
Although she took the top spot, it was unclear whether her pride, which had never missed first place since she was young, would be accepted.
“I’m worried. I must have been greedy because I even did it.”
Amy’s father, Shakora, spoke solemnly.
“Don’t frown. Pretending not to know is helping.”
Amy stopped in front of the two of them, bowed her head, and shook her shoulders.
“mom. dad.”
When she didn’t know what to say, she made a V with her hands while shedding tears.
“me… … You did it. I passed.”
Shakora, who was so moved, couldn’t control her emotions and hugged her daughter.
“okay! Great job, my daughter! you are the best!”
It’s 4th place now, but that doesn’t mean it will be 4th place forever.
How burdensome the second test must have been with the Karmis family’s honor on their backs.
‘This is the beginning, Amy! Be proud of what you’ve done!’
If you did your best and were satisfied, the child’s rank was not important to the parents.
“My daughter passed!”
Isis blushed as Shakora lost face and shouted.
“Honey, don’t do it. Like an outstretched arm… … .”
“Ahaha!”
Amy wiped away her tears with a sniffle and smiled brightly.
Unlike the Karmis family, which overflowed with family love, the members of the Mercodyne family were calm.
“I never expected you to graduate from school. My hair looks rusty now.”
At the first word of the albino, Arganes stabbed him in the side.
“Is that what you say to your son? Congratulations, Iruki.”
Arganes respected his son, and Iruki just nodded.
Although she was definitely a mother who grew up drinking milk, Mercodyne’s blood separates emotions and reason, so it was difficult for Arganes to deal with her son as he grew older.
“You sure rusted. Can I open it up and clean it for you?”
“Ku-k-k-k-k-k!”
The albino, who shook his shoulders at the impersonal joke typical of a Mercodyne, asked while touching his nose.
“Okay, what are you going to do now? If you really want to wash my hair, I won’t dry it.”
Iruki looked back at the Colosseum.
“I was satisfied enough. I will go to the dragon mine.”
The corners of the albino’s mouth rose meaningfully.
Machines use and discard, but humans replicate.
If it was Iruki, he wouldn’t be lacking as his successor.
“Are you okay? This floor isn’t too hard. I think being a wizard is a good life.”
“You said you were satisfied.”
It was enough to ask him twice to confirm his resolve.
“Graduate and come to the capital. Don’t get ready.”
Each family has a different disposition, but in the end, they are a family.
And on the other hand, a family that was worse than others was facing an awkward reunion.
“Congratulations.”
Ballroom shook hands, but Nade turned his head away as if he didn’t want to say anything.
Ballroom, who withdrew his embarrassing hand, pushed his wife’s back and said.
“You say something too.”
Teria glared at him terribly, but Nade wasn’t as scared as before.
Because you have the freedom to do anything.
“Are you going to be a wizard?”
Even if she wasn’t interested in her son, she was a quick-witted terria about which wizard was making a lot of money.
Of course, he knew that if he was second in the graduation exam, he could hit the jackpot on the down payment.
“no. I won’t be a wizard. There is no association that would take a guy like me.”
Teria’s expression crumpled.
“What the hell are you, why did we send you to magic school… … !”
“I get it. If you don’t want to do it, don’t do it.”
Teria raised her eyes at Ballroom’s words.
“honey! What are you talking about!”
“You stop too. We didn’t do well either. yes Nade. If you’re not a wizard, what are you going to do next?”
Even though they don’t want to mix a word, it’s family that opens their mouths nonetheless.
“I’m not quitting right away, and even if I’m not a public official, I’m going to do some work because I’m qualified. After that, I want to save money and open an alchemy shop. In my name, not West.”
The words were full of denial and distrust of the family, but Ballroom nodded and took out a document from his inside pocket.
“Take it. It is a land left to give to you someday. Sell it and use it to open the shop.”
Nade raised his head with a puzzled expression, but Teria was more surprised than that.
“honey! How could you not consult me… … ! No, before that, where did you get this money from?”
“It’s not your money. not my money Grandpa left you So don’t worry and take it.”
“You say that now! How do we live now!”
Ballroom took Nade’s hand and squeezed the document into it.
“There are opportunities for people. Maybe this is your last chance to be a parent.”
Nade looked at the envelope with his grandfather’s signature on it and handed it to Teria without emotion.
“take it. I don’t need it.”
The unexpected words drained the blood from Teria’s face.
“I want to do it alone in the future. So my mother writes. The money that went into me… … I will pay you back someday.”
Terria, who had to put out the fire urgently, had no choice but to accept it, but her pride was shattered.
“Are you going to cut ties? Are you saying you’ll never see me again?”
“It’s not like that. I’ll see you when things settle down. Take a look.”
Teria spoke softly the moment Nade turned around.
“… … I was going to go.”
Nade’s steps stopped.
“I was going to go back too.”
“i know.”
For the first time in his life, Nade could smile in front of his mother.
“Do not worry. Because I am not afraid anymore.”
I will not resent anyone or hate the world.
When we swim desperately to land, perhaps the day will come when we will laugh heartily.
While Nade sent his parents away, Sirone was having a long-awaited reunion with Lian.
“Thank you, Lian. I heard you.”
If it wasn’t for Lian’s prowess, he would still be wandering in the hell of the apocalypse.
“ha ha ha! Of course you should! You will be surprised how strong I have become!”
I could feel that I wasn’t the Lian I knew before, just by the aura that emanated from me.
“In that sense… … .”
Ryan said with his eyes shining.
“Let’s fight with swords. Revenge for past defeats… … ouch!”
Reina couldn’t stand it and slapped the back of her head.
“Everything you think is childish? What does it matter now?”
“This is an important matter for me! I have to defeat Sirone!”
‘It’s still the same.’
Despite his large body, Lian was Lian.
“Rian, I can’t defeat you with my sword anymore.”
Embarrassed, Lian cleared her throat.
“No, I didn’t want an answer like that… … .”
“therefore.”
Sirone laughed and said.
“I wish you well in the future.”
It was the answer I really wanted to hear.
“Of course, Sirone.”
Cut down anyone who threatens Sirone.
It was the first article of law inscribed in the Kingdom of Faith.

After the personal greeting, Reina officially joined hands and spoke on behalf of the Ogent family.
“Congratulations, Sirone. I knew you could do it too.”
“thank you.”
Sirone also bowed her head.
Without the support of the Ogent family, it would have been even more difficult to achieve the wizard’s dream.
“Ho-ho-ho! to be thankful Thanks to that, Ogent’s name became known to the world. You can’t pretend you don’t know later.”
“of course. After I graduate, I will go to say hello to the head of the household.”
In any case, since he took the top spot, it was obvious that various organizations would reach out, and wherever he was, he was with Lian.
“Here you are.”
When Iruki’s father Albino approached, Sirone greeted him nervously.
“hello. This is Iruki’s friend, Arian Sirone.”
“Sirone, don’t be too formal. Just think of it as air.”
Iruki became anxious at the albino’s words that he dared to meet Sirone and leave.
“I heard a lot about Iruki. Please take good care of our son in the future.”
“Please. They are friends.”
When the albino held out his hand, Sirone grabbed it.
“It’s not always like that when you go out into society. There could also be diplomatic problems.”
“Ah, but… … .”
“Today is a big slope. Please work hard for the kingdom of Tormia from now on.”
The albino’s words clearly had the intention of incorporating Sirone into their country.
“Why does my father decide other people’s future? It’s Sirone’s life, so let him do it on his own.”
The magic department was in charge of the contract, but as the head of the dragon, such a talented person could not be taken away by another country.
“It’s not even your life. I want to hear what Sirone thinks.”
It was clear that it was difficult to speak openly, but Sirone spoke openly.
“Nothing has been decided yet. I am thinking of making the best choice for me.”
Iruki let out a breath with a relieved expression.
“You thought it would work? Isn’t your hair really rusty?”
‘That’s why you’re still far away, kid.’
Iruki will follow in the footsteps of the albino and enter the dragon mine.
As the brain to oversee the kingdom’s policies, it would be a world of difference whether Sirone was present or not among the horses he could move.
It was the father’s heart that he wanted to put Sirone next to his son in advance.
‘Anyway, if it’s a friend, there’s no need to be too harsh.’
Albino, who had given up his greed, approached Vincent to relieve the stiff atmosphere.
“Congratulations. You raised his son wonderfully.”
When the highest nobility bowed, Vincent did not know what to do.
“no. We didn’t do anything.”
“Of course you would.”
“yes?”
When Vincent looked up, the albino smiled benevolently.
“The best parents are those who trust and watch over their children.”
“Oh, is that so?”
The albino, who had calmed down, turned around and spoke to Sirone.
“Come see me whenever you have a chance. It will be more helpful than your stupid son.”
“yes. thank you.”
Sirone also readily accepted this time.
Iruki, who was following his father as he moved, looked back and asked.
“Are you coming later?”
“Of course I should go. See you at the party.”
The tradition of holding a small party for successful candidates on the night after the graduation exam was the same this year.
“Sirone, when are you going?”
Amy, who had sent her family back, came over.
“Yeah, I have to go now.”
Amy, who passed Sirone right away, bowed her head to Vincent and Olina.
“hello. How have you been?”
“Heh heh, what the heck… … .”
While Vincent covered up the awkwardness caused by the difference in status with a broad smile, Olina took Amy’s hand despite her timidity.
“I had a really hard time.”
“Hehe, there’s also Sirone.”
It was a woman’s instinct, and Reina, who watched it, felt sick to her stomach.
Lian greeted her warmly, as if it was her sister’s feelings.
“Amy, that was really cool.”
“Lia An.”
Lian hugged Amy, who was running fast, and lifted her with force until her shoulder blades were crushed.
“Ugh!”
Amy, screaming mischievously, stomped her feet and came down when Caden approached.
“Are you going to the party?”
There is no doubt about the joy of passing, but it was heartbreaking to meet those who failed.
“huh. gotta go Do you want to go too?”
It is manners not to spoil the mood of the successful applicants, but it was the last chance for Caden to confess to Maya.
“no. With what qualifications do I go? I wanted you to give it to me instead. congratulations.”
“If that’s the case, I’d rather go with you. Maya should know enough by now.”
There would be no rush during the graduation exam, but when everything was over and I looked back, there was no way I wouldn’t know that Caden had protected Maya.
“That’s why I don’t want to go. Maya… … I hope you don’t get hurt.”
“Do not get hurt. This is the graduation that Maya desperately wanted. Rather, there are many things I want to say to you.”
Cayden shook his head.
“I want you to forget even that.”
“Anyway, stubbornness.”
Amy, who was on her back, let out a snort.
“What are you going to do next? I hate to say this, but I’m sure you’ll pass next year.”
Because there is no Maya.
The Red Cross will do anything if you don’t want it desperately.
“no. I’ll go back to my family If it wasn’t for Maya, I would have left the school.”
“Hmm, then what are you going to do now?”
“You have to think slowly. and… … .”
Cayden turned to Sirone.
“I have no intention of getting involved in your life, but Maya did her best for you. don’t hurt I won’t forgive her if she makes her cry.”
“You won’t forgive me?”
The last words touched Lian’s heart.
“I can’t accept that. I don’t know the circumstances, but Sirone will take care of it anyway.”
“If you don’t know the situation, get out. What are you?”
Blood rose in Lian’s temples.
“Ogent Lian. It is Sirone’s sword.”
“Sirone’s sword?”
Recalling the oath of knighthood, Cayden finally looked at Lian’s face.
“Ah, Ogent.”
Being from a famous swordsman family, Cayden had heard things before entering magic school.
“I heard that the Ogent family had a blue-haired man who didn’t have this much talent, so it must have been you.”
Even with a brief conversation, Lian realized.
In life, there will always be people you hate for no reason, and this dishonest guy in front of you will become one of them.
Just like his older brother Rai.
“Yes, I am the blue hair. But I guess you don’t know this. That there is no one who did not kneel before those who talked about their talent in front of me. Would you like to kneel here too?”
Caden burst out laughing.
“I believe in the size and play around… … .”
Even if it was Ogent, Cross, the best swordsman family in the kingdom, could not give up on it.
When Cayden applied a light press technique, Rian felt her body grow and widened her eyes.
A chill ran down Cayden’s spine as the technology was destroyed.
‘What is this?’
At the swordsmanship academy, he had encountered countless deaths, but it was the first time he felt his body split in two as vividly as he does now.
‘This guy… … It’s a ghost.’
It seemed as if the lives of the countless people he had cut down so far were being washed away.
‘I’m pretty blunt too.’
Conversely, it meant that he was far away from the battlefield.
‘It’s a sword.’
The time to reach a certain level was not important to the Red Cross, so I didn’t feel particularly nervous.
“Remember, Ogent Lian.”
As Cayden left, Sirone turned to Lian and said.
“We are going to the prom now, Rihanna, would you like to come too? I will also introduce you to my friends.”
“no. Today I’m going to have fun with my school friends. After graduation, come to Ogent’s home. For the time being, my parents will be staying there too.”
The Ogent family was already aware that Sirone’s graduation could bring an external force to the family.
“Ok, thanks.”
Their consideration was warm and their thorough thinking was reassuring.
Amy grabbed Sirone by the arm as Lian took her family to the carriage.
“Let’s go too. You should have fun.”
“Okay, let’s go!”
For the first and last graduation exam, I was thinking of drinking until I was drunk.
until you get really drunk.
* * *
Seven fingers pressed the piano keys with a bang.
Then, a mad melody rushed in, and the performer, Frings, swayed and sang with his eyes wide open.
“Sweet lover! oh! my love!”
Beside him, Fjord was poisoned and playing the violin.
Even the cracking voices and the bizarre cacophony were enjoyable, and a drinking party was held where the successful candidates and their acquaintances gathered.
“Cheers!”
Sirone, Iruki, and Nade sat down at the table and clashed beer glasses.
They were exhausted from fighting from morning to evening, but their hearts seemed to fly away.
“Big! It’s cool!”
Nade wiped his lips and looked around the party.
“Come to think of it, it looks like Maya isn’t coming.”
Cayden asked Amy to convey the words, but in fact, Sirone had some intuition.
‘Because the goodbyes are over.’
Iruki said.
“The lichen didn’t even come.”
“You must have lost your self-esteem. Because I was completely overwhelmed by Nade, who is of the same type.”
“It may not be the only reason. I thought I would have a big fight with Fermi, but he was unexpectedly cold-hearted.”
“Hmm, since I passed anyway, I guess I won in the end?”
“Not coming to the prom means you’re going to ride the black line. If you look at it like that, there’s nothing good about being entangled with us, right?”
“Well, because my father is a hired killer.”
“Ahahaha! Ahahahaha!”
Then I heard Amy’s laughter from the center of the hall.
“uh? Amy dances.”
A blush bloomed on Amy’s face as she held hands with Seriel and spun around.
“Passed! Wow! Seriel! I passed!”
“congratulations! congratulations!”
The eyes of the three people who had been staring at her in awe slowly turned away from her.
“I must have been drunk. Isn’t it dangerous?”
“What did we not drink? Leave it alone. It’s red-faced, so I’ll take care of it.”
At least today, every action will be innocent.
Meanwhile, Dante is meeting Closer and Sabina outside the party.
“Are you really not going to come?”
“it’s okay. You can’t break tradition. and… … I want to taste it when I’m really happy. I mean next year.”
Dante fully understood that feeling.
“Anyway, I’m sorry it turned out this way.”
Sabina said.
“Those who pass will pass. I feel a little better now.”
Everyone had potential, but the slightest difference made the difference between passing and failing.
Closer asked, turning to Sabina.
“Aren’t you going to see Nade? Or at least ask Dante to deliver the words.”
There was no way she didn’t know her feelings for Nade, but Sabina shook her head again this time.
“no. I can’t go to Nade yet.”
As Nade did in the past, those who stayed in school could not hold back those who went out into society.
“excuse me. I’ll go in.”
At that time, Liz asked for forgiveness from Dante and the others who were blocking the entrance.
“Ah yes.”
It was near midnight, so Dante, who had moved out of the way, stared at Liz.
She was a beauty, and it gave off an air of maturity to be called an acquaintance of a graduate.
“Wow, pretty. Who is your lover?”
Sabina asked, but Dante and Closer didn’t know.
‘Ha, what should I do? Should I just go back?’
Liz’s heart started pounding again as she stepped down the stairs.
‘No matter how you think about it, it’s strange. They’ll see me as a crazy woman.’
What would Nade think if he didn’t even come to the graduation exam and stormed into the party?
However, even after thinking about it for hours after the exam, I couldn’t bear to turn around.
Liz took a deep breath as she heard the grotesque music coming from inside the door.
‘Let’s think again while counting to ten. one. two.’
Just then, the door burst open and Nade, who was looking back, appeared.
“Puhahaha! hey! Anyway, that was too much! huh?”
He was about to go out with his friends to have an affair, when he saw a familiar face somewhere.
‘what? Are you drunk?’
Liz, pale and tired, raised a stiff hand in greeting.
“Oh, hello, Nade?”

[640] People leaving (3)
Nade doubted his eyes.
No matter how he thought about it, there was no reason for Liz to be here, who should have been in the capital’s arsenal.
Of course, that was just Ned’s thoughts, which exploded with emotion, and Sirone calmly grasped the situation.
“Uh, then shall we have another drink?”
“Wait a minute. I have something to point out. How hard do we go through then… … !”
When Iruki pointed with his eyes wide open, Shirone pushed him inside as if to tackle him and shouted.
“Then let’s talk!”
thud! After the door closed, Nade was finally able to accept the reality.
“Why is Liz-senpai here?”
There was only one reason why she came here, but if you ask why, she couldn’t bear to say it.
“that is… … therefore.”
As expected, nothing like a situation in which Nade was welcomed with open arms did not happen, and her thoughts were twisted, and she spat out anything.
“Then he left like that. I’m here to say congratulations. Congratulations on passing the graduation exam.”
He smiled and said it, but his expression and gestures were awkward.
“thank you.”
I thought that maybe a new future could be opened, but my already wounded heart did not open easily.
In front of Nade’s closed door, Liz realized that she could do nothing more.
How long after you broke up with Oscar would you knock on Nade’s door?
“then… … Have fun.”
Nade grabbed Liz by the wrist as she climbed the stairs.
“What if I leave like that?”
Liz shook her wrist as she was about to burst into tears.
“Sorry. wasn’t coming I’ll go.”
“Oh really!”
When Nade didn’t let go of her hand, Liz’s heel caught on the stairs and she fell backwards.
“Oops!”
At the same time, Nade, who had been pushed back, threw his back against the basement wall, and Liz hurriedly turned around to examine his body.
“are you okay? Aren’t you hurt?”
Nade looked into Liz’s wet eyes for a long time without answering.
“Can I not go?”
Liz shook her head and finally buried her face in Nade’s arms, unable to hold back her tears.
“Am I a very bad person?”
“It is not so. It was Mr. Oscar who betrayed you first.”
“still… … Anyway, this is weird.”
“I do.”
Nade grabbed Liz by the shoulder and pushed him away slowly.
“So, just this one time, it gets weird. I will never make you a strange woman again.”
A huge sense of relief came over her, as if the war had ended, and Liz cried out.
“Sorry! I’m sorry, Nade.”
Sabina, who looked down from the first floor to see Nade rubbing Liz’s back, turned away with a sad expression.
“let’s go. We have to train again tomorrow.”
“okay. Let’s fight mindlessly.”
Following Sabina, Closer placed a firm hand on her shoulder.
The graduation party lasted well past midnight, and it wasn’t until 4:00 in the morning that it hit the waves.
While most of them fell on the table and fell asleep, Sirone and the others left the party in a drunken state.
Nade, who escaped the crowd holding Liz’s hand, looked back at his friends and said.
“I’ll take senior Liz and go. You guys go in first.”
Everyone knew he wouldn’t be back today, but no one said it.
The graduation exam was over anyway, so it didn’t matter what I did.
“okay. I’ll see you tomorrow.”
As Nade left with Liz, Seriel realized something and slapped Amy on the back.
“Then I’ll go back to my inn.”
It was Seriel who had set up an inn in the city.
“this time? Don’t do that, go to sleep in my room.”
‘Anyway, since I’m a loyalist… … .’
It was lovely to see him like that, but at least for today, as a friend, he should have avoided it.
“it’s okay. I have to go up early tomorrow. You can see it at the graduation ceremony anyway.”
“Still, it’s dangerous to be alone… … .”
To say that night roads are dangerous for a licensed wizard is not appropriate, but emotionally it was a different matter.
“I’ll take you.”
When Iruki, who was sober, spoke, Seriel chimed in.
“That will do. If it’s Iruki, then I can be at ease.”
“… … what does it mean?”
“Come on, come on! It’s late, so let’s go quickly.”
Seriel, who was pushing away from Iruki, suddenly looked back and winked.
“Congratulations, Amy.”
Amy, who knew the meaning of the wink, blushed, but it was already too late to argue.
Unlike usual, when the friends left and only the two of them were left, the atmosphere suddenly became awkward.
“Would you like a little walk? Let’s get drunk too.”
As expected, Sirone didn’t ask to go in right away, and Amy nodded nervously.
“Is that so?”
The two strolled through the garden, each lost in thought, and sat side by side on a bench lit by crystal lights.
“Haa, this is the last time I walk here.”
“I know. I ran for today, but honestly, I never thought this day would come.”
Amy asked, turning her head.
“What are you going to do?”
“huh? what?”
“I think you went too far. Perhaps scouting proposals will come from all over the world. Tormia Kingdom, are you leaving?”
The criterion for selection would be the future, but what Amy really wanted to hear was the future between the two of them.
Knowing that this is a matter that cannot be easily answered, Amy was the first to get lucky.
“I think I will stay in Tormia. I will prepare for a public official for a year and submit an application for enlistment in the magic unit.”
The Karmis family was the first-class aristocrat of Tormia, and it was difficult to accept a proposal from another country in such a position.
“But Sirone, I want you to do what you want. Even if we go to another country, we… … .”
“I’m not going.”
“huh?”
Scouts are the inner thoughts of the unknown person, but they had to be honest with Amy.
“If you stay in the kingdom, I will stay too.”
“Bah, you idiot. It’s such an easy decision to make… … .”
“I like you, Amy.”
Amy’s heart started beating like crazy.
“I will join the Tormia Kingdom Magic Association. and with you… … .”
Thinking that it would be premature to talk about the distant future, Sirone asked with a smile.
“What do you think? If I stay in Tormia Kingdom to be with you.”
“You fool! That’s it, of course… … !”
Is it possible to limit the future because of love, with so many possibilities right in front of you?
But today, my head couldn’t win over my heart.
“It’s good. I like you too, Sirone.”
As soon as the consent was given, a thrill of joy flooded in.
“Amy… … .”
Amy, not having the courage to look at the slowly approaching sirone, eventually closed her eyes.
The emotions between the two were cautious, as if walking on thin ice, but the feeling of their lips touching was so surprising.
silence. Static again.
A night that seemed like it would never end was passing by.
* * *
The data of the graduation exam held at the same time at the magic school under the Red Line was spreading to magic associations around the world at a frightening speed.
It is no exaggeration to say that the infrastructure of the red line, which is based on the country, is wrapped around the planet, so the black line and the white line were also alert on the day of the graduation exam.
Some students will choose the black line, but entering the white line was not an option.
It was literally the hall of intellect where the world’s best wizards gathered, and they were the rulers of the magical world who did not even pay attention to the name of genius.
Above the border between the Kashan Empire and the Gustaf Empire, there is an ice zone that can be reached by passing through the Ice Sea.
People called that place the North Pole, and there was an ivory tower called the tip of magic built here, as cold as intelligence.
No matter where you start in the world, it’s the furthest place on the planet in a sense, but it only took half a day for the Red Line’s graduation exam data to arrive.
“Hmm, that sounds interesting.”
An old man was walking along the middle of a hallway wide enough to see that it was blocked by a wall in the distance.
Araka, the head of the Ivory Tower’s internal affairs.
He is 117 years old this year and has never been outside since becoming a resident of the Ivory Tower at the age of 16.
The Ivory Tower is a city with so many people working there, but only a few can go outside.
In the tower, they are referred to as stars and a surname is added in front of their full name, and in exceptional cases, there are people who work on a fixed-term basis by signing a separate agreement.
A representative example is Armin of the Gwangan, but considering that his magic is unique in the world, this case can be said to be rare in history.
Therefore, the title of Sungseong means that it is trusted by all the residents of the Ivory Tower, which cannot be compared with any power in the world, and it is a shackle that must not deviate from the orbital cycle of the intellect.
Currently, there are 27 people who have received the title of stars in the Ivory Tower, and they are solving superhuman difficulties by traveling around the world with aides called satellites.
The reason why not only the kingdom but even the empire are paying attention to the power of a single tower is because all the residents are wizards walking on the cutting edge.
And today, Araka had a list of candidates to become the new stars of the Ivory Tower.
“Taesung, I have something to report to you.”
When Araka reached the platform and uttered a voice, the light wrapped around him and moved his body into the sky.
Taeseong lives at the top of a tower, but the tower was an artificial planet that rotates just like a planet outside the atmosphere.
Out of the window, the universe stretches out, and if you look down, the continents of the planet stretch out like a map.
A beginner would understand the meaning of scale just by coming here, but Araka didn’t even turn his head and went straight ahead.
Upon arriving at the main gate of the Temple of Earth, a man who seemed to have only bones left was floating in the air with his cross-legged seat.
“It’s been a while, Araka-san. It’s been 1,273 days. Is it time for a new star to rise?”
It was Mahagartha, the Buddha (the enlightened one), one of the five stars that shine the most in the Ivory Tower.
“Bright Odaeseong, after a while, candidates for stars have appeared. Is Taeseong inside?”
“That’s something I don’t know. However, if you allowed the perforation, how about going in?”
Light emanated from Mahagaruta’s open eyes and enveloped the world, and the landscape changed in an instant.
Earth Temple.
If you look at the universe from this place surrounded by hemispherical glass, you will forget that the ivory tower has taken root in mankind.
“What do you mean by that, Araka?”
Taeseong was nowhere to be seen, but Araka prostrated himself at her voice.
“We received data from graduates of magic schools around the world. We have selected 10 candidates worthy of the title of star, so please refer to it.”
“Since they are still immature, what is there to refer to? It’s enough to give the title of star to the most outstanding person. Did you come to me just because of this?”
The Ivory Tower selects only the world’s No. 1 prospects, and, befitting its sharp standard, it does not even consider anything other than potential.
“Taesung, this time is a little different.”
“Hoo?”
Araka raised her head and said.
“For the first time in the human world, more than 90 percent of graduates have appeared.”
I thought the wind was blowing, but as the air gathered, a woman dressed in snow-white clothes appeared.
“Ninety percent.”
The voice that came out of the nurturing was also clear.
Araka walked to his knees and submitted the list.
“Please see and rate for yourself.”
It was a list of the 10 best prospects in the world right now.
1st. La Enemie (age 19): 98.7 percent.
Special Note: Incarnation Reincarnation.
2nd place. Dahlia Nane (age 17): 89.4 percent.
Specifics: None.
3rd place. Jin Voice (20 years old): 89.2%.
Special Note: Unlocker – Aether Wave.
4th place. Ariane Sirone (age 19): 88.9 percent.
Peculiarities: Unlocker – Particles of God.
5th place. Tona Jett, 18: 84.3 percent.
Specifics: None.
6th place. Wena Wizard (4 years old): 79.1 percent.
Special note: maternal awakening.
7th place. Galmun Claude (25 years old): 78.8 percent.
Special note: Eating out on a regular basis.
8th place. Levon Priya (22): 78.6 percent.
Specifics: None.
9th. Skye Weego, 20: 78.5 percent.
Special: Unlocker-Scale.
10th place. Muttal Trimone (age 19): 74.2 percent.
Specifics: None.

[641] Dead End (1)
Nade woke up in Liz’s bed and frowned as he felt the hangover from last night wash over him.
‘Senior Liz… … .’
When I turned my head in the vague memory like a dream, Liz was asleep with only her face pulled out of the blanket.
‘I should drink in moderation.’
Shouldn’t we remember it vividly!
“Hmm.”
Finding clothes scattered under the bed, Nade opened his eyes and slowly lifted the covers.
“stop. In situ.”
Liz smiled and stretched as the half-raised blanket was put back into place.
“Cunning. did you sleep well?”
“Hehe, it looks cold, so I’m going to cover you with a blanket. wake up. I have to go get breakfast.”
“Oh, I can’t eat. I must have had too much to drink yesterday.”
Liz, who was wriggling under the covers, crawled over to Ned and put her lips on her stomach and made a sound with a drum.
“Ha ha ha! It tickles!”
“Let’s wait a little longer and then leave. huh?”
Nade, who was looking lovingly at Liz’s face, gradually lost his smile.
“Leeds.”
“huh?”
“Won’t you regret it?”
Liz corrected her expression at Nade’s serious question, then jumped up and wrapped herself in a blanket.
“Why do you say that? do you regret it?”
“I will not become a wizard. I have no accumulated wealth. There must be a lot of hard work in the future, but I wonder if I can really make you happy… … .”
Realizing that, Liz smiled with a relieved expression.
“You don’t make me happy. We create happiness together.”
Nade, who had lived his entire life with a sense of responsibility, didn’t even know what happiness was.
“Let’s swim together. I will work hard too.”
“Liz… … .”
Nade looked at him with moved eyes, and Liz asked back with a shy smile.
“But are you really going to be okay? If the grade of graduating from the magic school was second, the future of the wizard would not be bad.”
Nade shook his head.
“My limit ends here. Iruki knew that too, so he decided to enter the dragon mine. If you’re satisfied, you can’t go any higher.”
“is it? It doesn’t matter if you don’t regret it.”
“Of course I want to be the best. But you’ll never be the best with magic. You know when you see Sirone.”
“Well, that kid definitely felt differently.”
“that’s right. It’s a subtle difference, but few people can imprint that feeling. that’s an area It’s the strongest competition that you can’t even dare to mess with except for Sirone.”
It was a battle of how much difference could be made between those who reached the same level.
“A pyramid of competition built with human blood and flesh. I’m down from there To go on a new road with you.”
“Thank you, Nade.”
With Liz in his arms, Nade looked back at the bright sunlight coming in and cheered for his friend’s future.
‘Good luck, Sirone.’

Tormia Kingdom Magic Association.
“You are annoying.”
When Lufist returned from attending the special trial and hit the desk, it splintered as if he had been cut with an axe.
“Did you finally get it through?”
Jane’s expression was also not good.
“It is unanimous. Sirone can’t graduate. Criminals are deprived of the right to use public institutions.”
“You are a criminal. What title is it?”
“Insulting royalty.”
“Sirone is… … Have you insulted royalty?”
The file folder Rufist threw fell under the broken desk, but there was no need to read it anyway.
“I committed twenty-three sins. I bet everything I could, such as omitting honorifics, belittling the royal family, molestation, and injury.”
“But isn’t that the problem that Miss Pony decided to deal with when she entered magic school? If you think about it like that, the other students have also committed a crime against Miss Pony.”
“The standards are ambiguous. That would be the case if the person in question only felt shame for Sirone. Being a commoner is really great.”
“I didn’t see him with that personality.”
“I guess so. These are pictures from the heads of politicians.”
“… … I’m going to tame Sirone.”
“okay. I really don’t think I’ll ever graduate. The average trade value of Sirone, set by scouts around the world, is approximately 2.25 billion gold. Apart from research, there are rumors that the Jincheon Empire has prepared 30 billion gold.”
Considering Jincheon’s aggressive behavior in the wizarding world recently, it wasn’t impossible at all.
“If Sirone is released as a free agent, the kingdom will not be able to afford it. Therefore, graduation itself is blocked at the source. They used the rule that those who do not qualify for graduation are not posted on the red line.”
“But it is a risky strategy. Isn’t the red line the only thing Sirone can choose from?”
“If you choose the black line, your family, friends, and everyone involved with it will suffer. The White Line hasn’t added any additional staff in nearly four years. Even if he did, what fool would refuse the kingdom’s offer expecting that he would be number one in the world?”
Sirone certainly set a great record, but Tormia was also just a country from a global perspective.
“It’s a situation where all sides are blocked.”
“The higher up thinks it’s certain, so they push forward. I’m going to ask for a lousy deal in exchange for getting rid of the insult. It must be about 100 million, and the rest goes into the pockets of politicians.”
“It is a bit bitter.”
“I don’t feel good as a wizard either. However, with this method, there is little chance of being taken away by other countries. No matter how we treat it, it is in our interest to strengthen the association’s strength. The negotiating team should have started by now.”
“Do you think Sirone will readily accept it?”
“You just need to close your eyes and bend once. Then graduation and future as a wizard are guaranteed.”
“Under the system of the Kingdom of Tormia.”
Lufist also knew the reason why Jane was caught.
“He’s a smart guy, so I can only hope he makes a wise choice… … .”
* * *
Returning to school, Nade finds the advanced class students gathered in front of the central bulletin board.
“what? Did something happen?”
As he made his way through the crowd to read the official document, his eyes shook in shock and his body turned around on its own.
“Sirone! Where is Sirone?”
When I opened the door to the dormitory, Iruki and Amy stood by, and Sirone was sitting alone on the bed.
“What happened? Blasphemy against royalty!”
Sirone raised her hand with a tired expression.
“Come on. Did you have fun with Liz-senpai?”
“It doesn’t matter now! What else is graduation cancellation?”
said Iruki.
“Don’t make a fuss. We already did everything when you were gone.”
Nade brought a chair and sat down.
“Why did this suddenly happen?”
“It must be the kingdom’s strategy. Pony sued Sirone. Ogent’s side is preparing an appeal, but it won’t work. Because it is a special trial by royal decree.”
There was life in Ned’s eyes.
“Where is Pony? I will meet you.”
said Amy.
“In the girls’ dormitory. But it’s already under control. The magicians of the Kreas branch of the Magic Association are guarding it fiercely. We almost got arrested when we tried to force entry.”
“The trainee is the problem! No, if you’re as good as Sirone, you can go in without being noticed!”
Sirone laughed bitterly.
“It was not led by Pony. Not that kind of personality. It must have been an order from the family. Iruki thinks it’s a ploy to lower the terms of the contract. So I’m going to wait and see.”
“No, even if I begged you to come, it wouldn’t be enough! gotta figure it out somehow Two of the sons of the highest noble families are friends.”
“It’s a royal order. A title of nobility doesn’t help.”
“Terase! Does that person know you? Even the royal family won’t be able to move if the empire steps forward!”
Iruki shook his head again.
“This is a matter within the kingdom. If Kashan interferes in internal affairs, use that as an excuse to move Gustaf and Jincheon. Do you see what I mean? We are no longer students. It is definitely a real battleground.”
“It’s real, and it’s irrational!”
“Don’t get excited, think calmly. If you are stamped in the kingdom, you can’t do business in this country either. If they get entangled there, Liz-senpai could be harmed too. do you want that?”
When I thought that, my heart sank, and the gigantic reality rushed in for the first time.
“As expected, in exchange for graduation, they will ask for a contract. By holding the family hostage. The best you can do is to raise the terms of the contract as much as possible. After all, Sirone doesn’t think it’s bad to stay in Tormia anyway.”
“Are you going to stay here? Do you look down on me like this?”
Sirone said while holding Amy’s hand.
“I don’t want to leave Amy behind. After all, you become a wizard. You can also get a job at the Magic Association.”
It was impossible to ruin all that happiness at the point where the sensation of the first kiss was still vividly alive.
“Oh really! I’m going to lose my temper!”
Unlike Nade, who had a tantrum, Sirone and Amy just looked at each other with apologetic eyes.
Resisting Wangseong’s decision means accepting that they can’t be together in the future, so they had no choice but to watch out for fear that they would get hurt if they spoke out first.
‘Yes, it’s okay to be a little unreasonable. With Amy… … .’
Because there will be far more happy days than sad days.
Then someone knocked on the door.
“Arian Sirone! It’s a royal decree! Greet the Executive Officer of the Royal Castle Magic Department!”
“I will leave now.”
After finishing her mental preparation, Sirone walked to the door and looked back at her friends.
“See you later. I will ask for your advice when negotiating.”
The entire school had already gathered in a circle in the central plaza, and a golden carriage was standing under escort.
Next to Liman, the Magistrate’s Executive Executor, stood a dried-up Pony with her head bowed.
‘You look thin.’
The wise wizard’s eyes were nowhere to be found, and the eyes were empty as if the soul was missing.
Pony did everything she could to resist the royal family’s decision, but she was also just a member of numerous royal families.
‘I am a puppet. Puppet of bloodline.’
Ignoring Pony’s quivering lips, Lyman read the official document clearly.
“Royal Decree No. 2467! The results of the graduation exam of Ariane Sirone, who committed the serious crime of insulting the royal family, are completely nullified!”
Even in the midst of numerous crimes listed, Sirone just calmly listened.
“but!”
As expected from Iruki, there was a twist.
“Because the benevolent Pony royal family said they would punish the lowly for their foolish mistakes, get down on your knees and apologize!”
Laiman, who folded the official document, pointed with his finger.
“Come on, get down on your knees and beg, you lowly thing! Put your forehead on the ground and bow down!”
It was the will of the state to tame the sprouts, but Pony, who had become a puppet, wanted to die.
‘I am… … What the hell is it?’
It seemed less embarrassing to be naked than this, and when Sirone’s knees bent, he even felt dizzy.
‘Hmm, surprisingly innocent. that the judgment has already been made. Then 100 million is too much, let’s start with 80 million.’
If I could save 20 million, I would lose about 500,000, and I was thinking of using that money to pay for my daughter’s study abroad.
‘no. I don’t like things like this.’
Watching Sirone’s hand go down to touch the ground, Amy bit her lip.
‘Because of me, because of me… … .’
He wanted to stop it right away, but he couldn’t help himself because he wanted Sirone as well as he did.
“You are a noble royal family.”
Contrary to her rhyme, Sirone, who had been thinking for a long time, slowly straightened her knees and turned her head toward the students.
“I’m sorry, Amy. me… … .”
Amy burst into tears and nodded her head.
“okay. Do it, Sirone.”
Sirone, who was only interested in her consent, opened her mouth as she glared directly at Laiman.
“I’m sorry, but I cannot honor that order. I have done nothing wrong to Pony.”
Laiman raised his eyes in embarrassment.
“What, what?”
Pony, who could not stand the shame, poured out tears, and Iruki muttered with a bitter smile.
“I ended up doing it.”

Everyone was silent, but the air was heavy, as if a thought had jumped out.
Rejecting the royal decree in the already known state was a challenge to the state’s public authority, and Ryman’s shoulders trembled in anger.
“You dare! Do you know what blasphemy against royalty is? I don’t deserve the death penalty!”
Now that Amy had given consent, Sirone had nothing to be afraid of.
“Neither arrogant nor against the kingdom. I’m just saying I didn’t do anything wrong.”
“this… … !”
Right before Lyman exploded, Pony couldn’t stand it any longer and turned and left.
“Pony!”
When the person who deserved the apology left, even Laiman couldn’t catch the strand.
It was only that he felt resentful of Sirone for making the situation this way.
“You will pay the price for your choices! Hang your head and wait!”
He wanted to punish Sirone right away, but there was nothing he could do about it because he had expectations from the royal castle.
When Laiman disappeared, the students rushed to him.
“Sirone-senpai! Are you really okay?”
Sirone just looked back at Amy and was grateful for her smile.
‘Amy.’
Can we think of the mind apart from the body?
Whatever the outcome, the distance between the two of them would be a little further away now.
* * *
As the teachers gathered in the meeting room of Alpheas Magic School noticed, Sade jumped up.
“I say it with the determination to be insulted. I think we should pass the bill to delay Sirone’s graduation by one year.”
It was the most realistic alternative, but Shiina’s sensibility was unacceptable.
“Sirone has achieved great results that will go down in the history of the kingdom. If graduation is canceled like this, Alpheas Magic School will also become a laughingstock of history.”
“But it is a royal decree. This situation could cause serious damage to Alpheas Magic School.”
“But you can’t make students the scapegoats for politics! Teachers have a duty to protect their students!”
When Shiina hit the desk, Sade raised her voice.
“Anyway, Sirone can graduate next year! When a storm comes, the boat must dodge. If you try to break through, everything will be submerged in the sea!”
Alpheas let out a long groan.
‘How did it end up like this?’
He recorded the best grades in the history of the kingdom, but being too good turned into poison.
said Olivia.
“Commoners have a weak foundation and are easy to shake, but they do not have a higher sense of belonging to the country than nobles. That’s what made the royal castle uneasy. If I had been a noble, I would have gone through the normal negotiation process.”
“So you want to watch?”
“It can’t be helped. Rationality is also created under the system. As long as the royal decree has fallen, there is nothing we can do.”
It was possible for Alpheas to arbitrarily force Sirone to graduate, but the aftermath would be truly terrifying.
“My head hurts.”
Alpheas let out a sigh and quietly left the conference room where all sorts of arguments were taking place.
* * *
“Where is Sirone?”
Nade arrived at the dorm and opened the door, but Amy and Iruki were the only ones left.
“I went out to get some fresh air.”
“You’re not thinking weird, are you? Like leaving school.”
“Not that stupid. nothing has been decided Let’s wait and see what position he will take in the royal castle. I might come up with a better deal.”
At the end of a day filled with Sirone’s stories, Pony was lost in thought without even drinking water.
‘I just wanted to become a wizard.’
From the moment I realized that the qualification was something I could always get, I lost everything in my life.
Sitting at her desk, holding a pen, Pony wrote down a will, and at the end added a phrase asking for permission for Sirone to graduate.
I climbed into a chair, tied a rope to the ceiling beam, tied a noose, and pushed my face through it like a necklace.
Finally, look back to see if this method is the best.
“I’m sorry, mother.”
Without a moment’s hesitation, I jumped off the chair and all my weight was concentrated on my slender neck.
‘what?’
Pony’s eyelids, which had been tightly closed, slowly opened.
My heart beat wildly at the death signal sent from my brain, and it was only moments later that I realized that someone was holding my leg.
Looking down, Pony’s eyes widened.
“Sirone?”
Sirone was looking up with a smile.
“This is not good, Pony.”
Is it really sirone?
As I twisted my body slightly thinking that maybe I was already dead and seeing an illusion, realistic pain tightened my throat.
“Ugh!”
Just before the load was applied, the wind cutter cut the rope, and Pony’s body landed on the floor like a doll.
“are you okay?”
Placing her hands on the ground, she turned away from Sirone.
“Why did you come?”
“I’m afraid you might be like this.”
“Then why did you come! I mean, I wanted to die. If I die, you will be able to graduate too, so why are you saving me?”
Sirone did not answer.
“go back. Because I still feel like I can die one more time. If you miss this opportunity, your life is over.”
“It’s not your fault, Pony.”
Pony’s face hardened.
“Isn’t it my fault? Do you think I would believe such a lie? Be honest. I wish I was dead, I wish I was dead and all this would go back!”
“I didn’t say I wasn’t angry.”
Sirone squatted down next to Pony.
“I also want everything to work out. But it’s not your fault. So you don’t have to die.”
The fact that he was shown the last moment when his life was dying was miserable, and the situation where he was being comforted by Sirone was miserable.
“what do you want?”
Pony jerked her head.
“What would you like me to do for you? money? authority? title? take it all It’s okay to take everything away, so please, please, finish it with this!”
“I don’t want anything from you. What I want is not something anyone can give me. and already got it At this moment, I can think and act like this.”
When Sirone touched Pony’s shoulder, Pony’s lips pouted.
“So don’t feel guilty. Even if no one gives me qualifications, I’m a wizard now.”
“mi… … .”
As the words she really wanted to say came out, she fell into Sirone’s arms.
“Sorry! I’m so sorry, Sirone! I am… … I am… … !”
Patting Pony’s back, Sirone whispered.
“are you okay. It’s not your fault.”
“Look how I have been. Sorry!”
It wasn’t that you could always become a wizard if you wanted to.
‘If I can’t understand it, I really didn’t get it.’
At that time, an employee of the Magic Association who heard Pony’s voice opened the door and came in.
“what! How did you get in here?”
An employee who confirmed that the window was open prepared for battle.
“damn! What are the outskirts guards doing!”
“Stop.”
Pony escaped from Sirone’s arms and approached them.
“But Pony! Sirone is strictly forbidden by the association… … .”
“Are you bringing up the signboard of the association in front of me?”
“Ugh!”
The association staff shrank their heads at the atmosphere that was different from before.
The energy emitted by the noblest lineage in the kingdom was not obtained through training or learning.
Pony turned her head and said with a friendly expression.
“Sirone, stop going back.”
“But you… … .”
“are you okay. I won’t be shaken now i will stay in school And I will definitely become a wizard.”
Realizing Pony’s will, Sirone smiled in relief and headed for the window.
“Good luck, Pony.”
“you also.”
As soon as the words were finished, Sirone jumped down.
Association employees reflexively rushed to the scene, but no one could find him as he cast the statue of Buddha.
* * *
“Graduate Aryan Sirone! The kingdom’s injustice cannot be tolerated by the students!”
Members of the Emergency Response Committee, which was formed around the student council, gathered at the school building and staged a demonstration.
Even Pony, the party to this agenda, was on the side of the committee, so the destructive power was considerable, and the teachers also seemed to want to follow the opinions of the students.
“I understand what you mean. We are currently preparing the necessary documents… … .”
At that time, Olivia, the teacher’s council auditor, accompanied the teachers and delivered the school’s position.
“What a fuss!”
Laiman led the soldiers and came running.
“Please graduate Ariane Sirone!”
“It is a royal decree! Do you all want to be arrested for treason?”
As some students flinched, Pony raised her head and stepped out.
“If you’re going to arrest me, you’ll have to do it first.”
“Miss Pony! Why the hell are you doing this?”
Lyman could not understand at all.
If she just kept her mouth shut, Sirone’s graduation would be canceled, and perhaps she could have taken Tio’s place.
– What I want to get is not what others can give.
Recalling Sirone’s words, Pony cut her arm horizontally.
“Go away. We will request a special inspection system in the royal family as an inherent right of the royal family. I will thoroughly reveal who is involved in this case and how much slush funds have been exchanged.”
“Waaaaaa!”
As if joining Pony’s declaration, the students cheered.
‘I’m still young.’
As the referee’s blade tightened his throat, Ryman calmed down.
“Anything you ask for. However, Sirone’s graduation will be put on hold until the trial is over.”
Now that this was the case, there was no choice but to drive it into a mud fight and kill time.
If Sirone doesn’t graduate anyway, the headwinds will subside.
“Miss Pony. In any case, the royal decree is still in effect. If we do not disperse the students, we will have no choice but to arrest them all.”
Olivia stepped out because it wouldn’t be just intimidation.
“Once everyone goes back… … .”
“excuse me.”
I turned my head to the voice I heard from behind the teachers, but the subject of the voice was already moving towards the committee.
‘It’s a great master.’
Even Olivia, certified second-class, was a skilled person who couldn’t even sense the sign of movement.
The man had a good impression as much as the pure white robe, but his eyes were sharp, and his long black hair was tied over the top of his head.
With his left hand behind his back and shaking a fan with a small bell, he opened his mouth.
“hmm… … therefore. What was your name? What did you say?”
“Sirone. How many times have I told you?”
A tiny creature like a baby appeared from inside the man’s robe.
Her skin was crimson red, her eyes were black like a panda’s, and she had a long tail like a spear.
“Is there any Ariane Sirone here?”
After tilting her head at the strange way of speaking, she suddenly came to her senses at the name Sirone.
“I am Aryan Sirone. Who are you?”
The man who had been staring blankly at the approaching sirone hurriedly groped for himself.
“Uh, so I… … . Where did you put it?”
The red-skinned creature sighed and held out a tile with three overlapping pentagrams.
‘It’s a star. It’s also three-star.’
Everyone who knew the meaning of the three stars shuddered in shock.
“We are from the Ivory Tower Balance Department. I have something to say to Arian Sirone.”
“Sang, the ivory tower?”
Amid the students’ murmur, a man holding a fan reached out to Sirone.
“Nice to meet you. My name is Arte.”
Ivory Tower 3-star villager, Ghost Demon Castle Arte.
“And I am called Satellite Tokei.”
Opening his mouth wide like a mischievous person, Tokay held out a card with an orbital trajectory next to Arte’s card.

[643] Dead End (3)
A star that orbits the intellect, and a satellite that orbits and assists that star.
As he held out a card that was too dangerous to carry around as a joke, Ryman became a dumb dumb.
‘Ivory Tower? No, why are you here in the ivory tower?’
While not daring to ask, Olivia stepped forward.
“I am Olivia, assistant principal of this school. What’s your business with Sirone?”
“It’s not really a big deal. It happens all the time around the world at this time of year.”
Arte, slightly bent at the waist, showed her face to Sirone.
“Congratulations. I entered the list of candidates for the title of star in the ivory tower.”
“What?”
The eyes of the senior class as well as the senior students were wide-eyed.
Three huge lines dividing the magic world.
It is a fact known to anyone aspiring to be a wizard that there is a white line in addition to black and red.
However, since the place is an ivory tower, it was only accepted as knowledge, and only students who liked delusion expected that it would have any connection with their lives.
Olivia, knowing that fact, asked with a blank expression.
“Sirone is… … Are you saying you are the best of the graduates in the world?”
Even she did not know the selection criteria of the ivory tower, but since ancient times, those who can receive the title of star have always been the best in a certain field.
Therefore, if the candidate was to be decided among the students, it should have been the best among the graduates.
“This time is a little different. Rank 1 is a bit ambiguous. That’s why I say it’s a candidate group. Sirone is ranked 4th by the standards of the ivory tower and along with 2nd and 3rd place will be put to a brief test to see if she is fit for the title of star.”
“Fourth… … .”
Ranking in the ivory tower meant ranking fourth among graduates worldwide.
‘Sirone, you really are a monster.’
There was no disagreement because he had seen the graduation exam with his own eyes, and the next thought that came to his mind was that there were as many as three more people who ranked higher than Sirone.
“We will set up a separate space to discuss the details. Originally, the screening was done by 2-star residents, but I was forced to come here because it is currently idle.”
The tone was soft, but it was also a request not to take up too long the time of a 3-star villager.
“Then shall we go?”
Arte raised a fan and pointed at the school building, and Sirone turned to her friends.
No matter who said it first, he nodded, and Nade pointed his finger and puffed out his mouth.
‘What are you doing! Go fast, fool!’
Seeing that desperate expression, he nodded his head.
“I understand.”
Arte was about to turn around with a hearty smile, but Laiman, who had been watching the situation so far, stepped forward.
“Please wait a moment.”
A voice came from behind, but Arte did not look back and spread his fan to cover his face.
I could only guess that it was a little annoyed.
“What happened?”
“Even if it’s an ivory tower, isn’t this out of order? Currently, Sirone is a criminal who committed serious crimes in the kingdom… … .”
“Whoa.”
Arte, who gently blew the wind out of his mouth, slowly lifted the fan that was covering his face.
“Landscape Wind.”
daughter and daughter.
A clear bell sounded in Sirone’s ears.
It was too loud to be a sound coming from a small bell at the end of a fan, and everyone’s expressions hardened as if they were thinking the same thing.
‘This time… … .’
In the feeling of slowing down, only Arte’s right arm, holding a fan, was moving.
“Executor! Dangerous!”
Sensing the intent to kill, the bodyguards passed in front of Laiman and pulled out their swords, and at the same time the fan made a popping sound and pushed the wind to the back.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
As a huge gale raged, the swordsmen drove their swords into the ground.
It felt like the walls were pushing against it rather than the wind, and it felt like my flesh was being ripped from my bones as it was being pushed away.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
I tried to hold on with the pride of the royal guards, but the wind power that humans could not handle was not enough, so both feet finally floated and flew away to the other side of the sky.
Tokay, clinging to Arte’s shoulders, put his hands on his eyes and watched the grass, trees, people, and wagons all disappear over the horizon.
There was nothing left in the place where the gale had blown.
Even the teachers couldn’t close their open mouths at the power that pushed away even a single drop of grass, and a shudder ran down the spine of Sirone, who was watching in front of them.
‘Blo-type magic.’
But can we call this the Blow series?
It wasn’t wind, it was a typhoon, and it was no wonder that Gaold floated to the surface with the power of another dimension of magic.
“No two words are the same, no matter how ivory tower.”
As Arte fluttered the fan with a displeased expression, a small bell sounded.
It was a separate act from magic, but just hearing the jingling made the students shrug their shoulders.
“It seems that the delivery did not go well. I’ll say it again. Sirone-kun has entered the list of candidates for the title of star in the Ivory Tower.”
It was the same story as before, but this time it was delivered correctly.
“Let’s go. It remains for me to solve one hundred and eighty-seven problems in this world. I hope Sirone-kun will drop it to one hundred and eighty-six as soon as possible.”
Sirone nodded slowly at the feeling she could not deny, and Arte turned and walked towards Alpheas at an exact right angle.
“Can I use the conference room?”
“However much.”
From the school’s point of view, if the Ivory Tower gave it to them, it would relieve the burden of solving Sirone’s agenda.
However, what was worrisome was the expression of a group of candidates, not a clear candidate.
‘Maybe this is the only chance for Sirone.’
Looking at Sirone and her friends following Arte, Alfeas prayed earnestly.
‘I hope I can hold this string.’
After entering the meeting room, Sirone looked at her friends in front of the door and looked at Arte.
“Hey, I’m sorry, but can my friends come too?”
It was promised to help once negotiations began.
“Oh, no. We can wait outside.”
Quick-witted Amy waved her hands, but Arte was fine if she could just finish it quickly.
“It doesn’t matter if it helps you judge. Have a seat.”
Seizing the opportunity to sit with the star of the ivory tower is more difficult than having an audience with the king, so Amy, Iruki, and Nade entered the conference room excitedly.
As Sirone sat across from Arte, Tokay jumped down on the table and walked over.
Tokei, whose spear-like tail was crossed over his face, smiled expectantly.
“Nice to meet you. He definitely looks like a different person from what I saw in his profile.”
I couldn’t tell if it meant good or bad.
“Ah yes. Nice to meet you.”
As Sirone quietly grabbed his tail, Tokay nodded as if he was correct.
In that state, Sirone asked Arte.
“You said evaluation. Are you being tested?”
“Do not worry. It’s not really a difficult test. The really difficult thing is that the two competitors have higher Kar values than Sirone-kun.”
“Kar shame?”
“Let me explain from the beginning. Because the most accurate delivery is the fastest.”
As Tokay waggled his tail, a blue glowing text was engraved in the air.
It was a record from 1st to 4th in the documents Taesung received.
Arte looked at it and said.
“These are the records from the Ivory Tower. As you can see, the first place is La Enemy. Karr’s figure is 98.7 percent. Originally, Lee should receive the title of a star… … .”
As Arte waited and gave them time, Sirone and his friends slowly looked at the records.
Certainly, it was significantly higher than the 89.4 percent of runner-up Dahlia Nane.
“La Enemy… … . Wait, La Enemy?”
When Sirone, who suddenly realized, looked away, Arte nodded.
“yes. This is Ankera’s previous life that Sirone-kun erased. It can be considered a later life in terms of time, but the Ivory Tower sees his incarnation as a previous life. That’s why there is still no special movement in heaven.”
Sirone said with a serious expression.
“But if Ra was born, an incident would happen soon. Do you have any countermeasures?”
“well. It’s something humans have to figure out.”
Arte added, flapping his fan.
“The Last War is certainly an important event for humanity, but it is not something that will interest the entire population of the Ivory Tower. That’s the case with me. Of course, some stars seem to be paying attention.”
It was a word that was not easily understood.
“If war breaks out, mankind could be destroyed, right?”
“It is not life and death. What the Ivory Tower values is the balance of the world. I see war as a process of restoring balance.”
Arte tapped the table with a fan at the sight of Sirone frowning reluctantly.
“I am not opposed to Sirone-kun’s idea. If you are interested in this, you can become a star and work for the Human Security Enforcement Department. After all, since we are also human beings, we want to be on the side of humans as much as possible.”
It was a strangely frightening word.
It was an interview for the best job in the world, so Amy changed the topic to prevent a clash between the two.
“So what is Karsuchi?”
“It is the standard of the ivory tower for finding the right person for the stars. It’s a metaphysical concept, so it’s hard to explain in words, but if you have to define it, you can call it perfection.”
Iruki tilted his head.
“Isn’t everything relative? What is your standard for perfection?”
“There are no standards. Perfection is just perfect.”
It seemed like it would make sense, but it was a difficult concept to dig into.
In any case, if that means perfection, the Sirone’s 88.9 percent figure is astonishing.
‘It means it’s almost perfect.’
That’s why he was able to rise to the list of candidates for the ivory tower.
‘but… … .’
Amy’s gaze turned to the names of Dahlia Nane and Jin Seong-eum.
If the woman with the surname Jin was from the Jincheon Empire, she would be a member of the royal family, and the child Nane was 0.5 percent closer to perfection than Sirone.
“How will Sirone compete with them?”
“As an incarnation of Ra, I made an unusual decision even in the Ivory Tower. It’s giving the top three people in the 0.5 percent range a chance. It’s simple. as soon as… … .”
Everyone’s eyes focused on Arte’s lips.
“You just need to find La Enemy.”
“Ra… … You want me to find it?”
“yes. There is no deadline, and the method is irrelevant. If you find Ra and return to the Ivory Tower, you will become a star.”
They say it’s as easy as breathing, but it wasn’t simple.
Even if I set out to find it, I couldn’t even figure out where to start.
Nade asked curtly.
“Aren’t you leaving the job in the name of a test? Ask Sirone to find something you couldn’t find even in the Ivory Tower.”
“ha ha ha! That’s right too. Currently, there are 27 residents who have received the title of star in the ivory tower. Due to the nature of traveling around the world, there is a shortage of manpower.”
“No, there is not enough manpower… … .”
“But Sirone.”
Arte interrupted Nade and showed his face.
“Becoming a star means having absolute authority that transcends national boundaries. Even the king has to follow your standards.”
That is the ivory tower.
“If you can’t even find Ra, you can’t get the title of a star. How is it? If you want to be tested, I will contact the upper management.”
Sirone, who was lost in thought with half-closed eyes, raised her head.
“no. I will not go to the ivory tower.”
“What, what?”
Her friends looked at her with absurd eyes, but Sirone did not waver.
“Hmm.”
Tokay scratched his chin and smiled meaningfully, and Arte covered his mouth with a fan and his cold eyes flashed.
‘As expected, the candidates… … .’
close to perfect

“Wait! Wait, wait a minute!”
While Arte hadn’t answered yet, Amy hurriedly held out her hand.
“Sirone, what are you really doing? Are you doing this because you don’t know what situation you’re in?”
“I know. But I don’t want to do something I don’t want to because my situation is not good.”
“You don’t want to. It’s an ivory tower, an ivory tower. It is a place that all wizards dream of.”
“I still can’t follow what isn’t right.”
“not right… … ,”
Arte lowered his fan and revealed his face.
“That is an interesting opinion. What are you thinking?”
“Kar Suu Kyi means perfection. But what you did, speaking of perfection, was, in the end, suppression by force.”
I couldn’t understand Arte’s judgment of blowing up Ryman just because he didn’t have time.
“Hmm, you seemed to hate it.”
“no, I do not want. But it’s not a matter of emotion. If strong is truth, how is the white line different from other lines?”
Tokay shook his shoulders.
“Hey, did I tell you? It’s different from your profile.”
Convinced, Arte folded the fan and drew an imaginary vertical line on the table.
“great. Let me explain. Man belongs to the number 3 of the law in that he chooses between good and evil. The vertex of these 3 can be said to be the seeker. But Sirone-kun, we are not seekers. It is an existence corresponding to 4 in terms of intelligence and law. In short, they are not beings who choose between good and evil.”
“Then what kind of an ivory tower is it?”
“It is an existence that distinguishes between good and evil. Is a line really a line? Is evil really evil? In other words, the most important thing in the number 4 of the law is endless criticism. And what this means… … .”
Arte stood up and offered a handshake.
“Congratulations again. Sirone-kun is well qualified to take the Ivory Tower test.”
Friends asked with puzzled expressions.
“yes?”
On the other hand, Sirone stared at Arte’s outstretched hand, then looked up in disbelief.
“If you said you would take the test from the beginning, does that mean you weren’t given the opportunity?”
“In my case, yes. As I said earlier, there is no special standard for Kar. Candidates who were notified by residents other than me may not have done this test.”
Arte smiled.
“The ivory tower is such a place. Being a star means being able to criticize anything, and I have only criticized Sirone-kun in my own way. Just like Sirone-kun criticized me and the Ivory Tower a while ago.”
‘aha.’
Amy understood a little what a kar was.
“Therefore, the inhabitants of the Ivory Tower support the Judgment of the Stars. Even if we have different opinions, we believe that it is the conclusion that came after going through harsh self-criticism. Is the strong the truth? If any villager has concluded that way, that too is close to perfect.”
Arte grabbed Sirone’s hand and shook it.
“Receive the title of a star. The Ivory Tower doesn’t force any ideology on you. It’s just to share with the world what you criticized with Sirone-kun’s intellect.”
Sirone’s heart started beating wildly.
It was only the thought of wanting to move towards a critical conclusion drawn through intellect, 100 percent Kar.
“for a moment. The thing to point out here is… … .”
Iruki came out.
“Anyway, since he became an ivory tower candidate, it can be said that Sirone has his own qualifications, right?”
“of course. Even if Sirone refuses, the door to the Ivory Tower is always open.”
“Then what are the terms of the contract? Wouldn’t it be impossible to accept a sudden offer without any of that?”
Tokay said.
“If you are talking about annual salary, the ivory tower has no pay. However, if it is necessary to carry out the mission, I can provide any amount of support.”
Even Amy was surprised this time.
“You really have no pay?”
“Because there is no need. Being trusted by the people of the Ivory Tower means being able to criticize anything, and already by convention you have full access to public facilities in countries around the world. If you’re hungry, go to a public institution and eat, and if you need something, talk to the king or a government official. We will supply and demand through the fastest route.”
“Wow, that’s really crazy.”
Upon hearing the preferential treatment, Nade felt what the Ivory Tower was like.
If this offer came to him, it seemed that he could revive his dream of becoming a wizard.
‘Well, that’s why I can’t.’
Nade’s car was far inferior to Sirone’s.
“Of course, only after receiving the title of a star. No preferential treatment is given to candidates. Before becoming a star, the first priority is to build the people’s trust in Kar.”
Of course it would, but Iruki wanted to take advantage of this opportunity even a little bit.
“Are you aware of the situation Sirone is in right now?”
“No, I don’t know.”
There was no need for 3-star residents to know the candidate’s situation.
“The kingdom of Tormia is preventing Sirone from graduating by framing her. What do you think about this part?”
“I wouldn’t be able to do it if I didn’t graduate. The Ivory Tower doesn’t care about anything but Karr. Sirone just needs to find La Enemy and come to the Ivory Tower.”
said Amy.
“But it is too much. The 3rd place is the royal family, so they have a lot of personal connections, and whoever the 2nd place is, they probably have a wizard license anyway, but at this rate, Sirone will have to travel as a civilian. I won’t say it’s unfair, but I can help you acquire the qualifications that Sirone could have in the first place.”
“Hmm.”
Arte tapped his head with a fan and was lost in thought.
“great. Can I just graduate?”
Sirone meekly nodded.
“yes. I think it would be much more comfortable to travel with just an unofficial wizard license.”
It’s not like I’m greedy now, but I wanted to have at least a diploma from a magic school with countless memories.
“All right. Let’s talk.”
Arte stood up and Tokei rode on his shoulder and looked back at Sirone.
“Be sure to become the twenty-eighth star. Wouldn’t it be nice to be the person we announced?”
“Yes, I will do my best.”
As Arte and Tokay went outside, the students who were whispering outside the building all shut up.
The teachers also looked nervous, but Arte calmly looked around as if he was used to this situation.
Then, sitting like a refugee and receiving treatment, Lyman flicked a fan and signaled to come.
“yes yes!”
Although he was not in good shape, he moved as quickly as possible and fell down at Arte’s feet.
The concept, which had been away for a while due to lingering about the cost of studying abroad for his daughter, returned after being hit by Arte’s magic.
“Did you call, you observer of intellect?”
“From now on, Sirone-kun will be tested by the Ivory Tower. Make sure your graduation doesn’t get in the way.”
“I will convey your will to the king. The will of the stars will be carried out smoothly.”
When you have a drink with a foreign official, you can often come across anecdotes of kings who were caught by the stars, and this was what they said in common.
If the stars want something, they just do it.
‘Because it’s already been criticized.’
It was an ivory tower business manual.
“Let’s go, Tokay.”
Tokay waved his hand toward the crowd.
“Then let’s all live happily and leave.”
A belt of light coiled around from Arte’s feet, then rose into a huge whirlpool and soared into the sky.
‘Is this the ivory tower?’
While the students stared blankly at him, Laiman gritted his teeth as he glared at Sirone, who had come out of the building belatedly.
It was intended to make her crawl between her crotches, but now she has become a person that even the king cannot touch.
‘Let’s wait. It has never ended well because it was stamped into the ivory tower.’
Since there are three candidates, the probability that Sirone will become a star reaches a whopping 33.3 percent.
If you touch it with a feeling of no way, the price you will have to bear in the future is too great.
“Aryan Sirone.”
Liman smiled and said.
“All sins are pardoned by royal decree. Please, I hope you become a great wizard who can raise the name of the kingdom.”
The royal decree did not fall, but it was a fait accompli anyway, and the students cheered at Laiman’s declaration of defeat.
“Wow! Sirone-senpai, congratulations!”
“It’s really amazing! An ivory tower!”
It was only natural for the students to be happy as being an ivory tower candidate was an honor for the alma mater.
‘Find Ra.’
On the other hand, Sirone’s odds were 1/3.
A problem that is different from anything we’ve tackled so far.
Also, the competitor’s car value was fine, but higher than that of Sirone.
‘Who the hell are you?’
Aside from competition, it was a pure curiosity Sirone.
* * *
The imperial castle of the Jincheon Empire, Yeomra.
As an empire with a population of over 200 million, the scale of Yeomra, where the emperor resided, was by far the largest among the three emperors.
The number of guards equaled that of the country, and the number of magicians alone exceeded 2,000.
It had an overwhelming advantage in terms of quantity, but it was unavoidable that it was inferior in terms of quality, and was currently recruiting talented people from around the world with astronomical funds.
“Princess, His Majesty the Emperor is looking for you.”
As soon as the lady-in-waiting finished talking, the eyes of the woman who had been immersed in meditation in the octagonal pavilion suddenly opened.
It was Jin Seong-eum, the 13th daughter of Jin Kang, the emperor of Jincheon.
The gaze staring straight ahead was hard as steel, and the stubbornly closed mouth was as red as flames.
“Let’s go now.”
As Seongeum prepared to step out, the ladies-in-waiting spread the distance equal to the number engraved on their respective jade necklaces.
The set distance from 10 steps to 1,000 steps means the right to approach the Seongeum, and if you take even one more step, you will hit the gyeong that day.
When they arrived at the imperial palace, where the eaves on both sides soared toward the sky, the guards erected their spears in perfect order.
Oh, the head of the guards, approached with a sound of ironclad armor and bowed his head.
“princess.”
The voice’s eyebrows twitched.
“Than 23. back off.”
“… … .”
It was a voice that distanced everyone he met, but it was impossible for him to leave his seat as the head of the Royal Guard.
“Huh, is that so?”
The moment Seong-eum snorted, Oh realized that he was 23 steps away from her.
‘… … There is absolutely no way I can do this.’
The obsession with space is due to a special realization that made her the best magician in Jincheon.
The reason why the emperor called her today was because she was nominated as a candidate for the ivory tower, where only the world’s best can enter.
“110 steps. 230 steps. 87 steps. 433 steps.”
Seongeum also distanced the guards one by one.
I don’t know the basis, but judging by the strangely understandable feeling of listening, it was clear that there was a certain standard.
As with Oh, when the soldiers did not leave their seats, Seong-eum raised her eyes, revealing anger.
“These… … !”
The maid who was the only one allowed to take 10 steps hurriedly said.
“princess. Today, His Majesty the Emperor specially… … .”
‘ether wave.’
As Seongeum focused his mind, all sounds disappeared and even the shape of the landscape was pushed out of cognition.
In a world that was only dark, countless tremors came like raindrops falling on the surface of the water.
If gravity is caused by matter squeezing space, it means that even empty space is filled with something.
What she realized as an Unlocker was the base that made up the space itself, that is, the ether.
‘Shoulder.’
Sensing the emperor’s wave, she cast her magic, and the 4-kilometer distance crumpled and the landscape of the Yellow Dragon Hall came flooding in.
In a state where different landscapes are in contact with each other, the bridge of Seongeum has crossed the boundaries of space.
“father.”
By just taking one step like that, she had an audience with the emperor of the Jincheon Empire.

[645] Dead End (5)
When the location of Seongeum was completely transferred to Hwangryongjeon, the crumpled space unfolded and the scenery returned to its original state.
It’s not a sight to see often, but the guards who have been hit a few times shouted while holding onto the handle of the sword without exception.
“Princess Mama! In order to have an audience with His Majesty, we must abide by the law!”
Seongeum didn’t even blink an eye.
“It’s just a daughter meeting her father.”
Her Kar value was 89.2 percent.
“However, if you do this, we… … .”
As the captain of the guards approached with an expression that could not do this or that, Seongeum’s hand was raised.
Ether Wave – Nagok.
As the space twisted, the guards commander’s body twisted like a whirlpool and disappeared completely.
“No matter how much Mama can do magic in the Yellow Dragon Hall… … !”
Starting with that, the guards disappeared distorted by the power of Nagok.
perfect closet.
The ability of vocal sound is powerful enough to distort the plate itself on which phenomena exist.
No one could overhear their conversation because there was no room for the sound to spread.
“Father, are you afraid of me?”
“Hmm.”
The emperor of Jincheon, Jin Kang, leaned his chin on the dragon statue and raised the corner of his mouth.
He had a physique comparable to that of the men of the Royal Guard, and his thick hair and beard, and his eyes were strong enough to contain the world.
“Is there any father in the world who is afraid of his daughter?”
“If you come, why do you keep troops?”
“Voice.”
A low-pitched voice shook the Yellow Dragon Hall.
“Yes, Father.”
“The world is wide and there are many people. To win the world, you need to make everything simple. Whether you are my daughter or whatever, bowing down to the Emperor is natural.”
Jin Kang asked while looking down at Seongeum, who was still standing tall.
“Do you think that Jincheon will not be able to embrace the world you dream of?”
The Ivory Tower is a transnational institution, and if Seong-eum becomes a star, Jincheon will lose valuable talent.
“It’s not the world’s problem, it’s my own problem.”
Jin Kang nodded.
“It would be nice to give it some time. But don’t forget Anytime, under any circumstance… … .”
Jin Kang’s eyes flashed.
“Simple beats complex.”
As the space split open, 200 guards surrounded Seongeum, and the captain of the guards standing one step ahead thrust a blade into Seongeum’s neck.
“Princess Mama, obey the law. No more disrespect will be tolerated.”
When the obsession of space was broken, Seong-eum glared at Jin-gang with fierce eyes.
“I grant you permission to take the Ivory Tower test. Do you want to try hard?”
“joy!”
At the same time as the vocal sound snapped, the guards captain’s blade bent like a snake and aimed at his groin.
“this… … !”
The captain of the guards, who was enraged at the rudeness shown in front of the emperor, chased after Seong-eum, but Jin-gang spoke in a low voice.
“it’s okay. Just let it go.”
“But Your Majesty the Emperor! Mama’s behavior a moment ago… … .”
“It’s because I don’t have iron. It will be fine, even in the ivory tower.”
It was a tower that Jincheon would break someday.
“Have fun and come, Jinkang’s daughter.”
* * *
One day before the graduation ceremony, Sirone and her friends ironed their uniforms.
It’ll probably sound like a ghost, but it’s comforting to think of it as one of the last hurdles to graduation.
After ironing, they sat side by side and started writing their graduation speeches to be read tomorrow.
About an hour passed like that, Nade grumbled.
“I hate writing. I fought to the death, so why do I have to do this?”
said Iruki.
“That is what life is all about. Why, there is such a saying. It’s not over until it’s over.”
“Mmm.”
Shirone nodded and looked back at Iruki.
“But isn’t that a word used in other contexts?”
“What do you know? I have no expectations of language.”
Sirone pulled out his head and looked at what kind of person’s graduation history was.
“Let’s see. If you’re crazy but have bad brains, you’re an idiot, and if you’re normal but have good brains, you’re a scholar. If you’re crazy but smart, you’re a genius… … . hey what is this Are you really going to read this?”
“Puhahahaha!”
Nade stuck out his tongue and rolled his eyes open.
“There is nothing I can do. we’re out of hell No matter what you say, the ghosts won’t listen.”
Nade said, wiping away tears.
“Still, it’s a data we keep in the archives, so be careful.”
“You?”
Iruki read Nade’s reading.
“An angel named Liz. The sun rose like a miracle on the surface of despair… … .”
“hey! Why look at other people’s things!”
Sirone sighed.
“It’s not some kind of love letter, and the juniors will continue to see it in the future… … .”
“So you write. A love letter that will be recorded forever. It’s romantic.”
Then there was a knock and Amy came in.
“Mr. Collie told me to gather in the music room. The school is practicing chorus.”
“Ugh, I really hate that.”
When I thought of singing in front of my juniors, my face already became hot.
Upon entering the music room, all the graduates were gathered.
Even if you choose a different line, you must receive a diploma, so Liken and Maya were also present.
“It’s been a while, Sirone.”
Maya came over and waved her hand.
“okay. I heard that you passed. congratulations.”
Although she received scouting offers from numerous performance troupes, Maya chose to audition and was finally able to sign a contract with the most famous performance agency in the kingdom.
As she produced many world-class singers, her future life would be as eventful as Sirone’s.
“thank you. I heard about it too. She said she came from the ivory tower. Alas, I should have seen that.”
Maya was making fun of it, but her heart was completely different.
I heard that he was dating Amy, but the two eventually fell apart again.
Having a gap with a man you have a crush on is something that makes your heart beat even if you have already given up.
Besides, if he became famous, he would be touring many kingdoms, and just thinking about it made his heart swell.
‘perhaps… … Wouldn’t there be a chance for me too?’
It was something I couldn’t bear to say.
How much would the heart of Amy, who was watching from the side, break if I gave her even a little bit of that feeling?
“Okay, let’s work hard. One day we will all be famous and we will meet.”
The school choir is the last part of the graduation ceremony, and some seniors suddenly shed tears, creating an indelible dark history.
It’s just a matter of singing for about three minutes, but Collie had a slightly different opinion.
“I plan to add Maya’s solo. I’m a singer and I’m going to become a celebrity, so it’ll be a good event.”
No one refused.
Maya’s song is excellent, but the school song was good if it wasn’t for her solo.
Following the procedure of the graduation ceremony, after an hour of rehearsal, the students went back to their lodgings and fell asleep early.
The morning of the long-awaited graduation ceremony dawned, and 10 graduates went up to the podium in the midst of parents, advanced students, and teachers.
When it was time to read the graduation speech, Iruki proudly stepped forward.
“If you’re crazy but have bad brains, you’re an idiot, and if you’re normal but have good brains, you’re called a scholar.”
Sirone and Nade broke out in a cold sweat.
‘I’m really doing it, that madman.’
The strange logic continued, and at the end of the graduation speech, Iruki spread his arms and shouted.
“When everyone calls me crazy, I will proudly shout: I’m crazy, and this world that says I’m crazy is crazy!”
Everyone answered in their hearts.
‘It’s just that you’re crazy.’
Amidst the chilly silence, Iruki lowered his arms and turned around.
“That is all.”
Nade got up from his chair, walked past Iruki and stood on the podium.
“You know an angel named Liz? Like a miracle to me in despair… … .”
The students did not understand the graduation speech, and the embarrassment was only up to Liz, who was sitting in the audience.
‘If you don’t want to write, just don’t write.’
She knew how annoying it was to write a graduation speech.
“So I become the best merchant!”
Nade yelled and turned around.
“That is all.”
As expected, there was no applause, and Shiina put her head down.
“Oh, just those.”
Ethella covered her mouth and laughed.
“Huh, am I good? Still, my juniors prick up their ears and listen.”
“That kind of thing has become a tradition, so shit comes out.”
Among the 10 graduates, including ordinary graduates, overemotional graduates, and self-promotional graduates, one by one, Sirone came out last.
It was a deliberate arrangement, and the effect was outstanding.
“This is Sirone-senpai.”
The person who broke the highest record in the kingdom and is now one of the three candidates for the Ivory Tower.
I didn’t know anything else, but I had to listen to Sirone’s graduation speech.
“I don’t think I have any talent.”
Sirone calmly read the words.
“I don’t even think I put in more effort than others.”
The crowd instantly fell silent.
“Talent and hard work are probably invented by people who have never really aspired to anything.”
I wanted to be a wizard and I liked learning magic.
“Failure was fun because I loved it so much, and hard work wasn’t too hard.”
That’s why a wizard must be someone who loves magic.
“If I hadn’t been as talented as I am now, I would have ended up here. Even if you didn’t have to coin the word effort, you would have polished your magic every day. Even if you don’t have anything. If it’s something that people yearn for, then humans have no choice but to go there in the end.”
Sirone put down the reading and looked at her juniors.
“Do what you truly love. No talent, no effort, can beat what you love. So don’t be afraid of anything and listen to your heartbeat. If you’re still running fast, you’ll get there eventually.”
Sirone smiled.
“That is all.”
“Thank you so much! Seniors!”
When Mark jumped up and shouted, all the students stood up and clapped.
When Sirone, who looked like a person from another world, said that anyone could do it, a warm feeling surged in her heart.
“You are a good graduate. I want to be an example to my juniors.”
Listening to the conversation between the teachers, Alfeas smiled gently.
“Sirone… … .”
Watching the boy who had crossed the wall at the age of 12 become a wizard who shocked the world and gave advice to his juniors made me feel a sense of alienation.
“Lastly, there will be a graduate school choir.”
‘Ah, it rains all of a sudden.’
The students lined up while fluttering their uniforms and sang a school song to the accompaniment of the music band.
If you’ve been listening to music for years, which is the first thing you hear upon entering school, you won’t be able to tell whether it’s a song or an incantation.
Nevertheless, Maya’s skills were the best, and when the solo performance began, the parents also fell into her voice in a daze.
‘I thought it was really childish.’
As the school song continued, the students’ eyes filled with sadness.
‘When this song is over… … .’
It really goes out into the world.
‘You’ve become a wizard.’
In Sirone’s head, all the events from admission to the present began to flow without exception.
I met good people and overcame many difficulties and matured.
“We are children of intelligence. Alpheas Magic School, you will shine forever.”
In the end, Sirone burst into tears, and tears flowed from the eyes of the other graduates as well, as the competition was fiercer than any other year.
“We are children of intelligence.”
All students sang with one voice.
“Alpheas Magic School, will shine forever!”
The graduation ceremony is over.

[646] To the world (1)
Jive Kingdom.
As a kingdom belonging to the Seven Kingdoms of the Temple, it was a country visited by many international students because of its citizens’ great influence and its free social atmosphere.
Dahlia Nane was also an international student.
From entering magic school at the age of four to becoming the world’s second-largest graduate at the age of seventeen.
An achievement that is unbelievable to common sense.
But in reality, if you look into Nane’s daily life, you will smile bitterly at the boringly smooth life.
“It’s me, have you made your decision?”
The headmaster of the Jive Royal Magic School personally visited Nane, who set a record in the kingdom’s history, and asked.
“no. I haven’t decided yet.”
The principal’s eyes were opened in wonder at the unexpected answer.
“After the graduation ceremony today, it will be announced to the Red Line Human Resources Department in three hours. If you’re going to take the Ivory Tower Test, you have to request a denial of disclosure.”
“Then I’ll think about it until then.”
The principal smiled plaintively.
‘He also has a good heart. Even if he doesn’t say anything, he probably wants to help the Jive Kingdom that raised him.’
Always polite and moral student.
I had never even heard of him arguing with anyone or frowning.
‘It’s only possible because he’s a genius.’
The fact that there were no three generations in my life means that Nane’s talent transcends those generations.
Even though he took the top spot in the shortest time in Jive history, I honestly wondered if he had even used 1% of his talent.
“You just have to make the right choice for you. Entering the Ivory Tower and making a name for yourself is the honor of the Jive Kingdom.”
As the same words were repeated, Nane spoke briefly.
“I’m tired of thinking about it.”
The headmaster shrugged at the blunt tone he heard for the first time, but it didn’t damage his reputation just this much.
‘Well, it’s not another institution, it’s an ivory tower.’
Even a genius would have no choice but to be sensitive.
However, contrary to the principal’s idea, Nane was actually happy with her future job.
Joining the Jive Magic Association, taking the Ivory Tower test, and dying right now.
‘Yes, now I… … .’
As Nane moved and fell into thought, the principal’s closed eyelids froze as if frozen.
Birds were stuffed in the sky, planets stopped rotating, stars orbiting the sun stopped moving.
The brakes were put on the entire universe.
‘What should I do?’
If there is no limit to the phenomenon, Nane’s concentration, in which the development of thoughts transcends time, is not a sin.
In the cosmic scale of immersion, Nane threw the infinite faceted dice toward the end of the accident.
Because I have mastered all levels, there is no standard for likes or dislikes.
And when the dice finally stopped rolling, he realized the only thing left of him.
‘decided.’
As Nane walked away along the corridor, the principal looked at her back with a friendly look and wished her luck.
‘Please make a happy choice.’
According to the red line regulations, 20 graduates were also produced from the Jive Royal Magic School, and when the order of the school chorus came, they started singing exactly in line.
“We become the light of the world as one.”
At the climax of emotion that made you shed tears involuntarily, Nane slowly stepped forward and took off her conquest.
‘Why are you doing that? Are there any events we don’t know about?’
The graduates looked at me curiously, but anyway, since I’m the main character, I continue to sing… … .
“me : yes! What are you doing!”
An unprecedented event in the history of the Jive Kingdom will take place.
After taking off her uniform, Nane took off her top, bottom, and even her underwear, then jumped onto the podium and burst into laughter.
“Ha ha ha ha!”
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
The female students covered their faces, but since I was the envy Nana, I couldn’t stop peeping through my fingers.
‘Now, what happens?’
There was only one thing I wanted to know.
The area of affair that has been reached at the end of all the degrees is the question of ‘just different’.
A journey to define Nane as the only thing in the universe, endlessly repeating differences.
“Eat this!”
As Nane turned her waist to the chaotic music of the musicians, streams of urine spread in a circle.
“Ouch! You must be crazy!”
Even as they hurriedly left their seats, people felt strangely terrified when they saw Nane spinning in the center.
‘How could that be?’
Being in its natural state meant perfect composure, without any tension or excitement.
“me : yes! stop! What are you doing all of a sudden!”
‘What if I don’t quit? What’s going on?’
When the strong stream of water was sprayed, the teachers hurriedly blocked their faces, and the students in the lower classes burst into tears.
In order to completely deviate from the scope of the concept, it would be necessary to consider more differences than now.
Maybe as many as an infinite number.
After casting the fly magic, Nane looked down at the humans and flew away looking over the horizon.
“What should I do, Headmaster? I’m going to the city!”
Should I report it?
The reason why there was conflict even after causing this situation was because Nane was the best student in the history of the Jive Kingdom.
“Call the guards! You don’t know what you’ll do in the city if you’re in that state of mind!”
“All right!”
Meanwhile, Nane, who arrived in the city, landed lightly in the middle of the market, where most people gather.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
Panic was a natural step, and merchants who thought it was a pervert approached with clubs.
“What are you? Are you determined to sabotage business?”
Since they were not interested in what they had already experienced, they did not urinate again, but the merchants’ hearts sank.
The pupils were not normal.
‘That guy is not a pervert.’
I was on the small side, but pure madness, complete uncertainty about the future, inspired fear.
‘What is the basis of difference… … .’
There is no reason for my actions.
It was an affair that was distinctly different from that of Do-do, and Nane went through the lowest level of difference.
‘First of all, the shape.’
Having made that decision, Nane headed to a tattoo shop, a specialty of the progressive Jive Kingdom.
“Come on… … Kyaaaagh!”
Whether or not the female employees who discovered the naked male body screamed, Nane stood in front of the full-length mirror.
“Make graffiti on my body.”
1 hour after that.
While 60 police officers surrounded the store and confronted it, the police chief raised his voice.
“Release the hostages! Procrastinating will only put you at a disadvantage!”
While listening to the sound, the staff inside the store couldn’t stop scribbling on Nane’s body.
In response to the instruction to engrave everything in the catalog, even severe swear words were written down her spine.
‘Ugh, that must be painful.’
Magical equipment developed to save time, but blood flowed all over the body.
Nane just stared at his reflection in the mirror calmly.
‘Is my form unique now?’
Or still converge on some concept!
‘Let’s try a little more.’
Nane grabbed all the piercings in the canister, picked them up one by one, and pierced her ears.
cringe cringe
The staff couldn’t stand it and burst into tears when they saw the 13 piercings put on while cutting the raw flesh.
‘A certain state that can only be called me.’
“Oh!”
Suddenly, when I turned around, the tattoo was missing, but Nane didn’t even pay attention and opened all the caps of the dye on the dressing table and poured it over my head.
“Oh no! The dye is poisonous… … !”
When I took a shower with all-colored chemicals while having scars all over my body, my flesh became hot as if it were burning.
“Quack! Kiki Kiki!”
He laughed exaggeratedly, tilted his head as if he didn’t like it, cleared his throat again, and burst into laughter.
“Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha ha ha!”
When the work was finally over in a state on the verge of going crazy, the employees knelt down and prayed.
“I’m done. Please leave now.”
“No, there is still one more left.”
When Nane stuck out her tongue and pointed, two of the five employees rolled their eyes and passed out.
“Hey hee hee hee! Hee hee hee!”
At the terrible sound coming from inside the store, the confronting security forces gnashed their teeth.
“What the hell are you doing over there? Captain, can’t we just go in?”
“I am a graduate of magic school. If you rush to subdue them, the hostages will not be safe.”
When the deaths came out, the Citizens’ Assembly would hold a hearing.
“Hey hee hee! Hee! Hee hee!”
The female employee who had the long sword tattooed on Nane’s tongue had a pale face, and her eyes were swollen from how much she cried.
‘This is hell.’
Perhaps she will retire as a tattoo artist, but she will forever be remembered as the one who gave Nane’s magic a singularity.
“It’s a sword.”
After clearly remembering the shape of the longsword carved into her tongue, Nane turned around and left the store.
“Arrest! Right Now!”
The 1st security team, masters of the schema, kicked off the ground and flew in and swung their spears.
‘battle.’
I think.
Then, as if time had stopped, soldiers floating at different heights were stuffed into space.
Concentration that far transcends the human category.
‘The sword of the wind.’
Its magical efficiency, which was so excellent that it was incomparable to anything, soared to the extreme through the obsession of the sword again.
The white light sword that was born on the palm of my hand loosened vaguely and scratched the surroundings in an instant.
“Aww!”
When dozens of scratches appeared on the steel armor worn by Team 1, Team 2 and 3 jumped in.
“catch! Don’t let them run away!”
As many as 60 people blocked the escape route, but this was a mistake stemming from not properly identifying the person named Nane.
What really needs to be blocked is his thinking, not his body.
‘Ah, that’s right.’
The universe stopped again, and Nane dismantled many concepts in the realm of the other.
‘The sword of flame. ice sword. electric sword. The sword of the earth.’
Each property is different.
‘A violent sword. soft sword. ugly sword. A cruel sword.’
Although the properties are the same, the feeling is different.
‘An unpredictable sword. A sword that predicts it. A sword that breaks that prediction. A sword that predicts it again.’
Even though they feel the same, their temperament is different.
‘Dismantling everything in every moment.’
In an instant, more than 1,000 dismantled concepts diverged, and none of the sword spectrums overlapped.
“This crazy… … !”
Before the marshal could even utter the words to retreat, numerous swords were thrown in all directions.
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooh!
It feels like everything is exploding in the first universe.
When the teachers from the Royal Magic School arrived three minutes later, the surrounding area was devastated with Nane at the center.
“I ended up doing it.”
It wasn’t until two hours after Nane disappeared that I realized that not a single person was killed just because I wanted to fight a ‘different’ battle.
Nane snatched clothes from the fallen villager and put them on.
There is no reason.
If the concept of wearing it again binds me to a certain category, I’ll take it off right away.
The headmaster, indignant at the casual robbery, shouted with his fists shaking.
“me : yes! What the hell is this! A hopeful future was guaranteed to you! Do you intend to tarnish the family’s honor?”
‘It’s the family’s honor… … .’
Am I a concept bound by bloodlines?
‘No, it’s not like that.’
Nane disbanded the surname Dahlia.
Then, he raised his index finger to cover one eye, then pulled out a long tongue with a sword engraved on it towards the principal.
“Hehehehe.”
The one who dismantles all the truth in this world.
I am psychedelic.

[647] To the world (2)
* * *
After resting at the Ogent family, Sirone finished preparing to leave with Lian.
I couldn’t rest for long as I had to go through an ivory tower test against strong competitors.
Tess, who came down from the capital during the three-day break, was making a lunchbox with Amy for the two of them.
“Are you sad, Amy?”
“… … .”
Since Tess had always supported Amy, she was furious at the situation of having to say goodbye to Sirone.
“Don’t do that, just talk. Whether it’s waiting, not meeting other girls, or meeting someone again, anytime and anywhere.”
What was most frustrating to Tess was that no promises were made between the two of them.
Amy smiled sadly and shook her head.
“I don’t want to. Because it’s useless anyway.”
“Why is it useless? You have to say something like that to make a man more careful about how he behaves.”
Amy’s hand, which was kneading the rice ball, stopped.
“Tess, do you remember that? When I went to Galliant the other day.”
Of course I couldn’t forget.
Fighting against the parrot bandits, as well as going to heaven and experiencing extraordinary things, was a trip.
“I once said this, that sometimes Sirone can be seen faintly.”
“Yeah, I remember. you did that Sirone seems to see the world from an omniscient point of view.”
“In the Ivory Tower, they call it Karr. The ability to exclude oneself and analyze phenomena objectively.”
That is why the inhabitants of the Ivory Tower place their full trust in the stars.
“Hmm, it’s definitely not that strong.”
“There is a saying that the worst person in the world is the one who harms you. It must mean that humans are still trapped in the existence of the country. But Sirone seems to be a little different.”
“You mean you don’t judge yourself?”
“huh. Of course, wizards always try to be objective, but Sirone denies even herself. Even when I hugged Marsha, and when I forgave the royal family called Pony. No, maybe this is just my standard, and Sirone may have followed the flow of logic from the beginning.”
“Do you think that went too far? Sirone is cold-hearted, but not cold.”
“I honestly don’t know.”
Amy recalled Sirone’s Karuchi.
“A kar figure close to 90% means that only 10% of the subjectivity is involved in the judgment. Definitely not human. Most humans act with the expectation of a premium on emotions, but Sirone’s actions are focused only on achieving a goal.”
Tears welled up in Amy’s eyes.
“So you don’t say anything. Words of waiting and promises of the future won’t have any effect on Sirone.”
The knife slammed into the chopping board with a thud.
“It’s not like that, Amy!”
Tess grabbed Amy’s shoulders with both hands.
“The human heart is not determined by numbers. You must be in that 10 percent. You will be filling the 10 percent with emotions that are greater than the 90 percent.”
“Is that so?”
Amy wiped her tears with her sleeve.
“Will Sirone really forget me?”
“of course! What if you, who knows Sirone best, get anxious?”
“huh. believe. Trust Sirone.”
In addition to the situation where they were about to say goodbye without a promise, and hearing the evaluation of the highest institution called the Ivory Tower, it seems that their hearts were weakened without realizing it.
Tess hugged Amy with a wide chest and said with a smile.
“Let’s make the most delicious food. Are we or those idiots going to eat at least?”
Only then did Amy regain her smile and nodded.
“Ahaha! That’s right, I’m sure it will be.”
* * *
While the two horses were waiting, Sirone took Amy’s lunchbox, which was still warm, with both hands.
“Thank you, Amy. I will eat well.”
“Take care of yourself. sometimes… … Send me a letter.”
Even asking him to send a letter felt burdensome, but Sirone nodded happily.
“huh. I’ll call you when I’m seated.”
Lian, who checked the time by the position of the sun in the sky, turned to the horse and said.
“Let’s leave now. I do not have time.”
Tess raised her ax eye.
“hey! If we break up now, we might see each other again, but won’t you say goodbye?”
“I will see you someday. Sirone has to compete with some great guys right now. Saying goodbye is not important.”
The nonchalant answer gave Tess a rather absurd expression.
‘What’s with all these guys?’
Ryan added curtly.
“Graduate from swordsmanship school. I mean join us soon.”
A smile formed on Tess’ lips.
“Heh, of course I will. After graduating at the top of the class, I will rise to a higher level than a drop-out student like you.”
“ha ha ha! I don’t know yet, but by then I will be the great swordsman the whole world knows.”
Amy was envious of the two of them talking about each other’s future even though they seemed to be arguing.
“right! I forgot this!”
Sirone, who put the lunch box in the bag hanging from the saddle, took Armand out of the Kubrick.
There must have been a change in Armand to some extent because there was a mental progress while taking the graduation exam.
Amy said, putting her hand on her waist.
“Hmm, that’s right. Now that you’ve become a wizard, you can carry weapons from now on, right?”
“huh. I try to wear it whenever possible.”
When the Diamond Armament was activated, the blade split and wrapped around Sirone, and organic matter filled the space between the metal frames.
– Multiple focus point detection. reset function.
Armand, who confirmed the state of quantum superposition, sought another change following Heaven.
“what?”
The shape of the angular, snow-white robe has changed to a calm gray and slightly worn hood.
It wasn’t just the appearance that had changed, and the first thing that was confirmed was that everything other than the artificial brain had disappeared.
‘It’s because of the quantum super position.’
If the cybernetic works in a state where thoughts overlap with the Force Dimension, it will be much more difficult to integrate into Ultima.
‘Valhalla action still stopped functioning.’
Theraze didn’t seem to have paid the price yet, but according to Miro, it won’t be long.
With the disappearance of cybernetic devices, Akamai’s antitheses also seemed to have shifted their functions to Armand’s robes.
“Hmm.”
When the antithese was opened, the robe split as if it had been cut with a knife, and dozens of pupils blinked.
“Ugh!”
Tess frowned, but from a tactical point of view, the blind spots disappeared.
Coupled with the ability of Ringer’s upper to respond immediately to impact, the user protection function could be said to be the best.
‘uh? Is this gone?’
The biggest change was that the tentacles of Kuzen the Eater no longer came out.
‘It’s because the psychology has changed.’
Even when Geumgang Armed Forces were changed in heaven, survival was the top priority, so the expression of traits also had an extreme sense.
Kuzen’s tentacles have the ability to absorb energy by chewing and swallowing living things.
It also has the advantage of being able to give physical shock, but it was definitely not a way that suited Sirone’s tendency.
‘The most important thing is that it is in conflict with the quantum superposition.’
An ability that was too active would become difficult to control as the number of overlapping events increased.
“Wait a minute, then how do you absorb energy?”
Sirone, whose mind is integrated with Armand, was able to immediately realize the change.
“Aha, you are eating me.”
“you… … eat?”
“The efficiency of energy metabolism has increased. So if I eat something, Kuzen will eat my body again.”
It was a more stable operation than finding energy from outside.
“But is it creepy? Do you think they eat you?”
“Eating is expressed, but it is just accelerating the metabolism. Starving yourself is the same as losing weight.”
After all, organisms live by digesting their own bodies.
“Still, the exhaustion must be severe. Wouldn’t that be dangerous?”
“are you okay. It’s me who decides to activate. In particular, Kuzen’s eating line is very useful when dealing with schemas.”
Furthermore, when combined with the Kenser’s ability to regenerate cells, it should have defense power against impacts applied to the inside of the body.
‘In other words, a 4-step defense system through Armand.’
In the first step, Akamai’s antithese restrains, and in the second step, Ringer’s upper protects the user.
In the third step, Kuzen’s metabolism promotion strengthens the body, and lastly, Kenser’s ability is to regenerate cells.
Of course, the actual battle would be different from the theory, but if you built a defense system of this level, it seemed that you could deal with any enemy.
‘Next is attack power.’
Galtomic’s ability to strengthen the law would enhance the power of magic as well as the light angel’s incarnation.
There was also a technological change in terms of pure horsepower amplification.
The magic boosting spheres mounted on both gauntlets were integrated into the right palm to further increase efficiency.
‘I’d rather have this. If you obsess over balance, you can’t create a variable when it’s important.’
This was also Sirone’s tendency.
“Do you like it.”
From form to function, it felt like I was finally wearing clothes that fit me after throwing off the extreme pain I had experienced in heaven.
“It’s fine if you like it.”
Lian said it was not a big deal, but Amy stuck out her tongue at Armand’s ability to strengthen the entire body.
It has been proven that Sirone’s ability alone in the graduation exam can create a great synergy effect, but now Armand’s function has been added.
‘Current Sirone… … How strong are you?’
On the other hand, Sirone liked the fact that the style, which was closer to decoration rather than function, changed to field use.
“I think I like these shabby clothes better.”
To be honest, thinking about walking around the city wearing a pure white robe without a single wrinkle made my face heat up.
“My activity has improved, and most of all… … .”
Sirone flapped her sleeves and smiled brightly.
“Is this waterproof?”
Amy had a dazed expression, but it was an important problem for Sirone, who had to wear it from now on.
said Tess.
“Are you bored with the most expensive clothes in the world? The designer’s name is engraved on good clothes. How about putting something like that in it?”
“Aha, yes.”
Thinking it was reasonable, Sirone closed her eyes and activated the ringer’s upper.
card win. card win.
The name Arian Sirone was engraved as a metallic line moved across the soft sleeve.
“How about this?”
Just like his simple personality, he had only one line of his name engraved on it, but that alone made him look much more luxurious.
“Yeah, that’s cool. You really feel like a wizard now.”
Sirone looked at Amy with affection.
Because a day would not be enough to bring out the feelings contained in them, they were just two people saying goodbye with their eyes.
“Then I will go! All is well!”
Tess put her hand on Amy’s shoulder as Sirone and Lian mounted the horse and waved away as they rode away at high speed.
“Don’t worry, Amy. In a few hours ago… … .”
“huh. I heard it too.”
Amy shed tears and nodded.
“Sirone.”
Lian asked as we were about to leave the home of the Ogent family and enter the mountain road.
“Why don’t you engrave Amy’s name on it too? I’m looking forward to it. It wasn’t difficult, was it?”
Sirone smiled happily and stared at the sleeve with her name engraved on it.
After a while, the sleeve was turned inside out to reveal the lining.
“Already engraved.”
Inside the name Arian Sirone, another line of words glistened in the sunlight.
Karmis Amy

[648] The way they live (1)
Leaving Creas City, Sirone and Lian tied their horses to a mountain trail and had a late lunch.
“it’s good.”
Unlike Amy’s packed lunch, which was packed with rice balls, the lunch box Tess packed was close to combat rations, but it was a satisfying meal for both of them.
“By the way, where are you going now?”
It’s a fairly late question, but since Rian intended to follow Sirone wherever she went, the destination was out of her interest.
What was better than when he was training as a knight was that Sirone used his brain, and as expected, the words came out smoothly.
“To be honest, it seems impossible to find Ra on my own.”
Sirone unfolded the world map brought from the Ogent family.
There were 70 of them with the name of a country once, and if you include the territory of tribes or different races, it would take a lifetime to travel around the world, which was not enough.
“Jin Seong-eum, did you say that the woman was from the royal family? It will be easier than us when it comes to navigation.”
“huh. But it’s not like we don’t have a place to rub.”
Although it was nothing compared to the imperial family, Sirone’s connections between school and heaven were considerable.
“First of all, there is Mr. Miro. No, maybe Mr. Miro has already met Ra.”
“But the important thing is that you don’t know where Mr. Miro is, right? How about a person called Theraje? Anyway, if I go, I might be able to meet you.”
If it was Kashan, it would not be inferior to Jincheon’s information power.
“huh. Depending on the situation, you may need help. But it is too far away to do anything right now.”
Ryan looked at the map.
The world can be broadly classified into four lands.
It was the North Pole with the Ivory Tower, the continent where the kingdom was gathered, the East across the Atlantic Ocean, and the South across the equator under the East.
The largest territory was, of course, a continent, hugging the Atlantic and South Pacific in the form of a sigma ∑.
The continent is again divided into Northern Continent, Central Continent, Southern Continent, and the Middle East. Sirone’s hometown, Tormia, is one of the 21 kingdoms in the Central Continent and is located on the South Pacific side.
“Since Kashan is in the northern continent… … .”
The northern continent is the only territory of the Empire, and Kashan and Gustav share the border.
“Even if you keep going up from Basuka, you will have to pass through Yakma, Kazra, Ferris, Biden, and Jive kingdoms before you arrive.”
It was a dizzying journey just thinking about it.
It was a test with no time limit, but given the skills of the competitors, it would take at least a year to find Ra and pass.
Sirone said.
“Looking for Ra right now is too vague. So, I think, first, I want to visit the magic school Ra graduated from.”
“aha.”
When you go to the school, you can check the approximate personal information.
“But you don’t know what school Ra graduated from?”
“That’s why we’re going to the capital. Someone knows for sure.”
“who?”
“Scout Mr. Baikal.”
Thinking that she could get help if she asked Fleur, Sirone robbed herself and got up.
“Let’s go. I have to sleep in Kentra for the night and arrive in the capital by tomorrow.”
Arriving in Kentra after riding for four hours, Sirone and Lian left the horse at the stable and entered the city.
Like a pastoral city, cowboys could be seen everywhere, and unlike Creas, where there were many old ladies, tomboy ladies were running around laughing.
‘Sensei Shiina said she met Kuan-san here.’
Now, recalling the dream-like work of heaven, the place he visited was the wizard guild.
“Silverling Guild.”
After reading the signboard, Sirone turned to Lian and explained.
“I have an unofficial wizard license, so now I can use the guild too.”
“But can we find information about Ra here?”
There was no possibility that a single guild knew of a person who could not be found in the ivory tower.
“Maybe it will be difficult. But there’s nothing wrong with experiencing it. It looks like you can stay overnight, so let’s sleep here tonight.”
Since it was winter, the sun set early and the weather was cold, so Rian followed Sirone’s words without a muttering.
When I opened the door and entered, there was a cozy space with torches hanging everywhere.
At the table, wizards were reading books or playing chess, and some of them were already drunk and sleeping on their stomachs.
I saw the stairs going up to the second floor, and there was a counter on the way there.
“welcome. It is the haven of wizards, the Silverling Guild.”
A woman sitting at the counter stood up and greeted the business.
“what?”
When the two younger than expected entered, the woman looked at them with interest.
“Are you two wizards?”
“no. I’m just a wizard. This is my friend.”
Ryan added.
“It’s an inspection.”
Checking the large sword hanging behind her back, she nodded.
“okay. I am Estera, the manager of the Silver Ring Guild. What can I help you with?”
“I was wondering if I could stay overnight.”
“huh? Are you new to the guild?”
Sirone honestly nodded.
“Yes, this is the first time.”
“no wonder. Accommodation is provided free of charge to guild members, so you cannot use it. Why don’t you take this opportunity to join the Silver Ring Guild? If you’re a wizard too, you’ll have a lot of comfort.”
Even if you have an unofficial license, you can make a living and collect information, so joining a guild was essential for an unofficial wizard.
“Hmm.”
As can be seen from the anecdote of the Parrot Mercenary Corps, there is no world-famous wizard guild in a kingdom led by the Magic Association.
However, according to Sirone’s investigation, the Silverling Guild was one of the three major national guilds representing Tormia along with War Wagon and Blood Rose.
It was not a bad proposal since each region opened a branch to handle various tasks, but there was no particular advantage to Sirone, who was planning to leave the kingdom of Tormia anyway.
“I have no intention of joining a guild yet.”
“Huh, it looks burdensome. You do not have to worry. Joining and leaving the Silverling Guild is free.”
The main goal of a guild is definitely power expansion, and as such, the war of nerves between guilds nationwide is fierce.
The way to join and leave freely was also the Silverling Guild’s business strategy to retain as many people as possible.
‘It’s free registration.’
It was nice that the accommodations could be used for free, but I was still cautious.
“I’ll think about it a little longer.”
The moment Sirone spoke, Lian’s eyes changed.
It was because he felt fierce hostility from the wizards in the hall.
All of them must have belonged to the Silverling Guild, and they couldn’t feel good about their guild being ignored by a boy who had just entered society.
Her heart was the same as Estera’s, but as expected, she didn’t change her expression like she was a resourceful person.
“Yeah, if you’re comfortable with it, do it. The door to the Silverling Guild is always open.”
In the end, we ended up staying somewhere else, but Sirone asked after coming to the guild.
“I heard that you can get various information from the guild.”
Estera’s business-minded eyes twinkled.
“of course. It costs money, but that’s it. What information are you looking for?”
Sirone looked at Lian once and asked.
“Do you have any information about a man named La Enemie?”
Other than that, there was nothing else to ask.
“La Enemy?”
Estera tilted her head, raised the corners of her mouth as if she had a good idea, and raised her index finger.
“It’s 1 gold.”
“yes?”
Sirone blinked his eyes as if it were absurd.
“I just asked, do you have any information about a guy named La Enemy? You have to pay 1 gold to hear the answer.”
“Are you paying to know if there is information or not?”
It was out of common sense, but this was the physiology of the guild.
“All information from the guild turns into money. Guild members might not know, but outsiders don’t know anything for free.”
Laughter was heard in the hall.
“They are little kids who don’t know the world. If you want a free one, go ask your mom.”
Ryan just crossed his arms and closed one eye gently.
‘What do you want to do, Sirone?’
The philosophy that the sword does not judge was effective here as well.
‘Well, so the current possession is 300 gold.’
It is a large amount at face value, but it is not so if you consider the journey ahead.
Above all, there was no way to know if even this type of question was actually asking for money, or if it was Estera’s cunning revenge for having hesitated to sign up.
“I’ll pay you 1 gold.”
So Sirone paid the money.
If you don’t make it clear when you have a chance, you’ll make mistakes when you really need to.
It was surprising to Estera that she was willing to give the amount of 1 gold, but there was no hesitation in collecting the gold coins that came up with a thud.
“Now tell me. Do you have any information about La Enemy?”
Estera, who tingled and flipped a coin, gave a short answer.
“there is.”
“Is there?”
Sirone’s eyes opened in bewilderment.
“Are you really there?”
“You should know what happens if you cheat on this floor, right? wait at the table I’ll pack it up and go.”
Sirone, who had been staring blankly at Estera as she entered the archives room, finally looked around the hall.
Unlike the people of the Association, the tough-looking wizards were looking this way.
A wizard with an eyepatch on one eye, a wizard without a right arm at all, and a wizard with burns on their faces.
When Sirone and Lian sat down at the table, the guild member serving poured them tea.
Even as she sipped the refreshing tea, Sirone did not understand.
Does it make sense that there is information about La Enemy in wizard guilds in the provinces, not even in the capital?
“Hey, kid.”
The one-of-a-kind wizard called.
“Are you a magic school graduate?”
“Yes, by the way.”
“Kuk-kuk. I knew it. it’s written on your face What can you get from such an insignificant guild? But, this floor is not as easy as you think. If you’re a graduate of a magic school, you’re considered an aristocrat, but if you stay with that attitude, you won’t be able to accomplish anything.”
Sirone listened silently.
Indeed, if there was information about La Enemy here, they were mistaken enough to completely revise their existing strategy.
After waiting for about an hour while receiving contempt from the wizards, Estera called them to the counter.
“Did you find the information?”
Estera took out twenty-seven cards with the silver ring guild mark on the back.
“This is an information card. Marks are different, but most guilds trade information with this.”
Information loses its value the moment it is confirmed, so a special form was needed for monetary transactions.
“All this card is La Enemy’s information?”
It was a much larger number than expected.
“huh. I brought all the information that included the keyword La Enemy at least once. 100 percent accurate.”
“how much is it?”
When I asked without hesitation, Estera raised the corner of her mouth.
“2 gold each.”
To buy all twenty-seven cards, you had to pay a whopping 54 gold.
“Isn’t that too expensive?”
“No, rather lucky. Because all 27 pieces of information are ‘pure’.”
Estera explained.
“All of the information here was purchased with money from someone. And when you say a keyword like you do, you sell the information it contains.”
Certainly, in this way, intangible information could be traded as if it were a commodity in a store.
“You can think of the 1 gold you paid as a keyword value. And pure state means information that no one has seen yet.”
Even the same information is valued differently by each person, so it was reasonable to set it based on the number of readings.
“But how do you believe that?”
“Of course there is no way to prove it. So the difference in amount is not that big. Information that has never been read is 2 gold. Information viewed even once is worth 1 gold and 50 silver. Information that has no security value because it is read too much is sold for 1 gold.”
Sirone, lost in thought for a moment, placed 2 gold.
“Then I’ll just buy one.”
“good. What would you like?”
“The very last chapter.”
Chances are you’ve already read the information as you transcribe it onto the card, so you put the one you thought was most important last.
“Good judgment. Be careful not to show it to others.”
Sirone, who quickly snatched the card, still couldn’t take her eyes off her even after checking the front side.
‘This is such a world… … .’
Below the informant’s name was a single line of text.
-La Enemy is ‘supposed’ to be male.

[649] The way they live (2)
“La Enemy is… … .”
Lian, who raised her voice in absurdity, swallowed her words.
Even the mediocre information was paid for, and the fact that Sirone had a meaningful smile also played a part.
‘But what about this… … .’
Of course, it is quite possible that Ra was reincarnated as a woman.
Even so, it was not a major issue for Sirone, and if a man is a man, what is ‘presumption’?
‘There’s no one who feeds you like a school.’
Sirone felt the same disappointment, but since he learned the physiology of this world, the 3 gold was not too wasteful.
‘Obviously, Ra’s gender may be important to some people. Therefore, it is difficult to see that this reduces the quality of information. but… … .’
As expected, what bothered me was the word estimate.
“Please explain.”
Estera was quite surprised when Sirone’s eyes suddenly turned sharp.
‘Was this his personality?’
Most of the magic school graduates looking for a guild were cases where they abandoned their hopes of becoming public figures and jumped into livelihood activities.
Particularly, if it is a kid who has just graduated, it is part of the job to put a dump at the discretion of the manager.
This is because the rookie has to make the most of the profit even if he loses money in dealing with the veteran.
‘What about this? Just tell me?’
As usual, asking for an explanation would be the correct answer, but looking at Sirone’s eyes, it felt like a sixth sense that had dealt with so many wizards was sending a warning.
‘Let’s watch a little longer.’
Estera explained, deciding to follow her sixth sense.
“Information traders classify information into four levels. Check, guess, doubt, rumor. Of course, even in this case, verification is difficult, but only for the confirmation level, evidence or documents must be attached.”
“Then what is the estimated grade?”
“It’s like a confirmation level, except you don’t have to attach anything. So, unless you are a magician who handles information professionally, most of them tend to sell information at a presumed level.”
Because wizards traveled to various regions, the amount of information they saw and heard was far superior to that of ordinary people.
Therefore, after completing the request and returning to the guild, it was a structure to raise additional income by selling the information obtained during the trip.
‘Information from all over the world is gathered. Then the number of people using the guild will increase, so it’s not a loss for the guild.’
Ryan asked.
“But how can I believe it if there are no attachments? In this case, there is nothing but trust.”
“The buyer has to bear that. In any case, information is only an auxiliary means to accomplish the mission. That’s why other wizards don’t ask for information beyond the estimated level unless absolutely necessary. The only thing I can say is that at the level of national guilds, information is not traded carelessly. Under the card was the informant’s name?”
Sirone recalled the name Marka Inter engraved on the card.
“Anyone can buy, but only guild members with clear identities can sell. If in doubt, going directly to the informant would be a good idea. Emphasize that guilds are not government agencies. It’s good to know that in any guild, work must be done based on trust.”
“What if the informant is fraudulent?”
“Guild membership will be revoked. All guilds connected to its own network will be contacted.”
Estera, aware of Sirone’s concerns, added.
“Of course, it cannot be said that there is no betrayal, but there is no end to looking at the bad side. Most of them work based on trust, so the guild can survive.”
If they didn’t take their share and leave this floor, there was no way they would destroy the guild system, their means of livelihood.
Sirone nodded and asked.
“How much did the owner of this card sell the information for?”
“Fifty silver.”
The guild earned a whopping 1 gold and 50 silver, but it was a reasonable level because the wizard Inter would have sold various information.
Honestly, if there was no system called guild, who would buy this kind of information for 50 silver?
“In the end, there was no information about the confirmation level.”
Estera smiled shyly.
“that’s right. There was no information about the confirmation rating with keywords. As I said before, it is the domain of experts. The verification is thorough, and the price is quite expensive.”
Lian grumbled.
“Then shouldn’t I have told you from the beginning?”
“Huh, thanks to you, you learned a lot, didn’t you? Think of it as tuition.”
“Sometimes what about trust… … .”
Sirone interrupted Lian.
“I’ll buy them all.”
Estera, doubting her ears, asked back.
“huh? what?”
“You buy all the information cards here. There are twenty-six cards left, so you can pay 52 gold, right?”
The moment Sirone placed 5 Intermediate Gold Coins and 2 Lesser Gold Coins on the table, Estera realized the identity of her sixth sense.
‘this child… … .’
Fairly fast.
The fact that it was the first time in a guild was enough to know from the actions so far.
Still, buying all the information cards was a decision that defied all the many mistakes newbies would make in the future.
‘Certainly, veterans would have made the same judgment.’
Estera, whose pretense had disappeared, held out her card.
“… … take it.”
Sirone, who put all twenty-six cards into her bosom, turned to Estera again and asked.
“And I want to join a guild.”
This too was the right decision.
‘He changes his posture really fast compared to his age.’
If it was only 10 minutes ago that he was being criticized by the wizards, he had a tendency to thoroughly exclude emotions in the performance of missions.
Although his skills were unknown, it could be said that the future was quite bright for him to work as a wizard.
“good. Now, to be honest, joining a guild will make you feel really comfortable. The fees are much cheaper, and above all, B-level or higher requests are only provided to guild members.”
What Sirone was thinking was also there.
“yes. So I want to do some work too.”
If you buy information with money, you can sell it on the contrary.
In particular, the Silverling Guild was free to join and leave, so it was intended to make up for the cost on the way to the capital.
“Hmm, do you have something specific you want? There are many fields such as combat, negotiation, training, navigation, and transportation.”
“It would be nice to carry. I am going to the capital.”
“Aha, there is one thing that is just right. Also count the unit price. Can I check your mage’s license first?”
Sirone took out an unofficial license.
“Here you go.”
When I put it on the table, Estera picked it up and examined it.
“what? Alpheas Magic School? This is the 5th most prestigious.”
It was rare for a person from a prestigious school to join a guild, so I was more interested in it.
“The name… … .”
Estera’s face stiffened after confirming the statement.
At first I thought it was a misread, but no matter how much I checked, it was the name she knew.
“Arian Sirone! Are you a sirone?”
Finally, as her thoughts and memories coincided, Estera’s eyes widened as if they were going to pop out.
They, who have long since entered the profession, cannot be interested in a single student’s name, but Ariane Sirone was special.
Wasn’t he literally the student who set the best record in the kingdom’s history, and now he’s a candidate for the Ivory Tower?
Ryan showed a smile on his face.
“Whoa, did you get caught in the end? Yes, this is my lord Arian Sirone. And I’m Mach’s… … .”
“what! It’s Aryan Sirone!”
The wizards in the hall jumped up.
Even if they were candidates, they knew that only those with skills equivalent to that of a country’s great wizard could receive the title of star.
When I thought that, I felt that Sirone, who had looked like a young child with no down on her hair, seemed big enough to pierce the ceiling.
Estera gulped and looked at her license.
‘This is real. It’s not forgery.’
Once it became known that Arian Sirone had joined the Silverling Guild, it was not a matter of overtaking the other three major guilds.
‘What do we do? I have to catch it. Oh really! The Master must go out at a time like this.’
There was no way Estera didn’t know what she was thinking, so Sirone demanded confirmation once again.
“Joining and leaving are free, right?”
“Well, of course.”
He smiled and said, but his heart was different.
‘But not you.’
Of course, it’s not a level that you can hold on to if you want to hold onto it.
Also, if you were undergoing the Ivory Tower test, there would be no reason to join a guild within the kingdom.
‘But that’s why there’s no reason to leave, right?’
After organizing her thoughts, Estera handed over the key.
“Once you have decided to join, you will have to provide lodging. Take this and go to room 3 on the 4th floor.”
“yes. But don’t you have to fill out paperwork or something?”
“Ho-ho-ho! You don’t have to wait, do you? I’ll go to my room later and take care of it. That’s right, here’s the license.”
The quality of service jumped up as much as there was a trick, but Sirone didn’t have an aftertaste anyway.
“yes. Then let me ask you a favor.”
As Sirone climbed the stairs, magicians rushed to the counter without saying anything first.
“Estera! Can you give me a copy of your guild member license? No, sell it to me! How much is it?”
If you sell the information at a confirmation level with proof documents attached, you should be able to get more than 100 gold.
Estera sighed and said.
“Wake up the dream. From now on, this information is exclusive to the Kentra branch of the Silverling Guild. Go and have a drink.”
The magicians licked their lips and turned around, but they walked to the exit, not the hall.
Given the location of the ivory tower candidates, wouldn’t the information of the estimated class be of considerable value?
That was the guild’s trust, and based on that trust, Sirone’s position quickly spread throughout the kingdom.
* * *
Room 3 on the 4th floor, where Sirone entered, was a large room with seven beds.
“I don’t need to do this.”
Even a child knows that waste is a fact, but it was excellent in that it showed the will of the Silverling Guild.
“Anyway, that’s fine. Because it’s free.”
After Rian said that and lay down, Sirone, sitting on the bed across from her, took out the information she had purchased from the guild and read it.
“Right, I bought a card. how is it? Do you have any useful information?”
As Sirone read the cards and put them down, Lian came over to the bed and checked them one by one.
“Let’s see, La Enemy is presumed to be a wizard… … . What are you talking about?”
Of course, this could be important information to some people, but Lian was only wasting 2 gold.
There was also some noteworthy information.
“Estimated to have graduated from the magic school of Kazura Kingdom. Suspected height between 175 and 180 cm. Rumor has it that he met a person from the ivory tower. what?”
After reading the next card, Lian frowned.
“Rumors that La Enemy is deaf?”
Then he shredded the card on the blanket.
“Can I sell you this nonsense?”
“By the way, other cards have similar information.”
Sirone selected a few cards and showed them.
“Rumor has it that La Enemy is blind. He is suspected of having a rare disease. Rumors of being dumb. They are all different informants, even from what you saw.”
“It sure is strange. But some information must be false. Being a wizard is a presumptive grade.”
“It’s hard for me to believe easily, but it’s also ambiguous to ignore. If it was fraudulent, wouldn’t it be possible to be expelled from the guild, and in the worst case, retaliation?”
In that sense, even the informant was willing to risk his life.
“But how about this? Rumor-level information was trash from the beginning. Then there will be no retaliation. Besides, isn’t it okay to talk about rumors as they come out?”
Ryan’s words were right.
“is it? The confirmation level requires evidence, and the presumption is probably about seeing the evidence.”
“Then what about your doubts?”
“Isn’t it trustworthy enough to listen to the person in charge? If you put it that way, rumors are what someone heard.”
“… … Really not worth it.”
“But putting all of this together, I have discovered one important fact.”
Sirone pointed to the word Enemy written on the card.
“First of all, there is too much information. Especially since Kazura has closed the border right now.”
Sirone’s paternity scandal was the cause.
“what? Come to think of it, how did information about Kazura get to Tormia?”
“That’s the point. Guild members from other countries are also getting enough information about the estimated grade. Therefore, the Ivory Tower does not know where Ra is.”
Sirone’s thoughts were close to certainty.
“You know, but you can’t find it.”
The existence hidden in that strange contradiction.
“Even knowing… … Can’t find it?”
That was La Enemy.

[650] The way they live (3)
Rian didn’t understand Sirone’s words, but that was exactly what Sirone wanted to convey.
“It was good to come to the guild. I think I thought it was too easy.”
“Heh, even with La Enemy, the guild wouldn’t agree. Of course, I approve of you, but if I just hear your name and tremble, I don’t care.”
Lian confessed the dissatisfaction he felt on the first floor.
“Information cards, too. They say no one read it, but who knows? When we leave tomorrow, we will sell it again for 2 gold.”
“haha! In fact, a system of this size is not easily fooled. Because we doubt everyone else.”
“Hmm, but it’s a loss to lose 50 silver just because you read it once. What are you going to do when you buy a few hundred copies?”
“I will still buy it.”
Sirone held the information card in her hand.
“People usually take long periods of time vaguely. For example, if you have to do something for a year. However, if you look closely, even a year is made up of 1 second.”
“It doesn’t.”
“If we assume that it takes 1 year and 30 minutes to find La Enemy, what if someone takes 1 year and 29 minutes?”
Ryan blinked.
“It’s too far away, so I can’t take it sensibly, but this situation can happen. Also, what is actually happening at this moment is our world.”
Sirone put up a card.
“One minute difference. Winning or losing depends on whether or not you read the information even one day first. If a year’s efforts could be wasted in just one minute, it’s not a loss to give them 50 more silver.”
That is the philosophy of those who live in this world.
No one suggests a way, and you have to do it yourself from one to ten.
‘You’re too young.’
I felt anew how competent people were by my side and how easy it was because they were there.
Sirone threw the card onto the bed.
“Of course rest is important. You can’t run for a year without eating or sleeping. You will have to make a lot of right decisions.”
“I guess if you obsess over the little things, you might miss out on the really important things. That’s why I bought all the information cards.”
“huh. I don’t know if anything will help us. I think wizards from other guilds probably made similar decisions.”
Then Estera knocked.
“Sirone, are you in?”
“Yes, come in.”
Waiting until the words ran out, she came in with a guild application and a pen.
“I wrote down all the necessary forms. Just check and sign here.”
Sirone looked at the terms and conditions.
Guild members were divided into Rookie, Senior, Veteran A, and Veteran B, and the fees as well as the benefits were varied.
“Hmm.”
As Sirone was examining the Rookie rank, Estera, quick-witted, gave a further explanation.
“The guild will definitely promise you the best treatment. But even so, you can’t raise the guild member’s rank at will. This… … For the guild members, it is like life.”
The higher the grade, the easier it is to earn money, and of course it was a matter directly related to honor.
“are you okay. Because I thought it would.”
To be honest, if he offered preferential treatment to raise his guild rank, his credibility would have fallen.
“Instead, the guild will pay for all the incidental costs for your request. If you’re going to deposit in the guild, we can drastically raise the interest rate.”
Sirone said honestly.
“Estera, actually, I don’t intend to be active in the Silver Ring Guild for a long time.”
“I know. All world famous wizards are like that. As long as you don’t withdraw, the terms of the contract we proposed will last for 5 years. If it’s a guild from another country, you can join multiple guilds.”
What Estera wanted was a document to prove that Arian Sirone had joined the Silverling Guild.
That alone would give them an edge over the Kingdom’s three major guilds, War Wagon and Blood Rose.
Sirone was thinking the same thing, so I didn’t feel particularly burdened.
‘Because the guild is definitely comfortable in my own country.’
Sirone, who took over the pen, asked.
“Still, are you free to leave?”
“of course. I am a wizard too. Not that stupid.”
Of course, even if the chances of capturing Sirone were slim, he had no intention of giving up.
‘Since I’ve done everything a manager can do.’
The real match came after Sirone arrived at Basuka, where the headquarters of the Silver Ring Guild was located.
“Oh, and about the request.”
Estera took out the letter from her bosom.
“Guild activities aren’t the goal anyway, are they? Then this would be the easiest. The rewards are high, too.”
“Should I deliver the letter?”
“huh. You just have to go to the address written on it and hand it over to Brooks. There is a certificate enclosed inside, so get that person’s signature and go to the Silverling Guild in the capital. Then it will give you 87 gold. Of course, the amount minus the commission.”
“87 gold? It gives a lot.”
It was only for the price of delivering the letter.
“Because the request fee is not necessarily determined by the degree of risk. There are cases where the request fee is higher for a noble to find a lost cat than to fight for his or her life.”
“okay.”
“Of course, I do not entrust this kind of request to just anyone. I want you to think of it as a sign of showing the trust of the guild.”
“Can I open it?”
I have no interest in reading other people’s letters, but since they weren’t sealed, words could come out later.
“doesn’t care. Because the client didn’t ask for it on purpose.”
“Because you are more suspicious?”
It was human nature to want to dig up the more tightly hidden.
“Depending on what was going on. You may not really have any thoughts. But this time your guess is correct. The letter is written in code. It’s a personal password, so I can’t read it either.”
“It’s a password.”
No matter how comfortable the request was, the risk of 87 gold seemed to exist.
“all right. I’ll tell you when I get to the capital.”
Estera asked as she got up from her seat.
“What time are you leaving? We’ll have a wagon waiting for you.”
“yes? Until then… … .”
As far as Sirone knew, even the lowest tier wagon rental cost more than 10 gold per day.
“are you okay. As I said earlier, all unit costs are paid by the guild.”
The value of Sirone’s name would be more than enough to pay off, but the calculation to lead it to the headquarters of the Silverling Guild was greater than that.
Since she joined the guild in order to make the trip as efficient as possible, Sirone didn’t care about trivial matters.
“We’ll be leaving as soon as the sun rises tomorrow.”
“good. Then I will know that and prepare. Come see me anytime if you need anything.”
When Estera left, Sirone and Lian looked back at each other and shrugged.
Definitely everything was comfortable.
* * *
The two got up before sunrise, washed their bodies, and went down to the first floor.
The guild members had yet to go to work, and a small wagon was waiting in the empty lot outside the back door.
Estera approached accompanied by a man in his 50s with deep wrinkles on his forehead.
“Let me introduce you. Guild member Austin, who will guide you to the capital this time. He is 53 years old. His major is fire-related. Guild rank is Veteran A.”
“hello. This is Sirone.”
“It’s Austin. Please take good care of me.”
His skinny body and strong impression spoke of a stubborn life.
“I’ll be leaving right away, so get in the carriage.”
As Sirone and Lian entered the carriage, Austin glared at Estera with his eyes wide open.
“What are you doing now? Ask me to be the coachman of the rookie who joined yesterday?”
“You’re not just a rookie.”
Austin knew who Sirone was, but the pride he had built up over 30 years as a wizard was not so easily broken.
“Anyway, why me? There are others.”
“Oh, why would someone who knows do that? I’m not asking the coachman to do it, but to take Sirone to the main store. Then the guild expands, isn’t it good for Austin? I will pay you well.”
“Do you think I’m getting older and attached to the silver ring because of money? Even the Archmage can’t tell me what to do with my life.”
When she didn’t break her stubbornness, Estera let out a sigh.
“Austin, have you ever seen the Archmage?”
“No.”
“is it so. I’ve never seen one either. therefore… … .”
Estera said while biting her molars.
“Can we both just shut up and just do it? I’m bleeding right now too!”
He had no intention of treating someone who had been in the guild for 30 years harshly, but it was a different story with Sirone.
It means to leave if you don’t want to.
Austin bit his lip at the unexpected contempt, but eventually turned around with a sad expression.
“… … OK.”
There was no way that Veteran A was unaware that money was everything.
“sorry. I couldn’t sleep, and I must have become nervous because I was preparing.”
Estera wasn’t comfortable either, but work was work.
“I know you are struggling. The manager doesn’t do anything.”
You have to work to eat and live.
Austin, who got into the driver’s seat, fixed the saddle and opened the passenger compartment window.
“Then we will depart. I’ll take the fastest route, so rest in peace.”
“thank you.”
Sirone wasn’t careless, but anything he said would only touch Austin’s insides, so it was good to take a break.
After leaving the city of Kentra, March passed through the wide plains of Sadia, the hometown of Nade, and entered the edge of the Underground Mountains.
This meant that there were three hours left to the capital.
“huh?”
For the first time, an expression appeared on Austin’s face as he drove the carriage without stopping.
“what?”
A woman, staggering as if injured, was walking straight towards the carriage.
Austin, who had gone through all of the prenatal battles, spoke at a distance.
‘It’s quite far from the city, but why do people… … .’
“Help me! Help me!”
A woman who found the wagon came running, holding on to her torn clothes with one hand.
“Stop!”
A ball of fire rose from Austin’s hand.
Still, when the woman did not stop, she threw a spark at the halfway point.
“Kyaaak!”
Austin shouted, this time with both hands equipped with fireballs.
“Don’t be fooled! My fire magic has no mercy!”
Sirone and Lian opened the doors on both sides of the carriage and got out.
“What happen?”
“Come in. It’s a minor matter.”
It wasn’t a trivial problem from Sirone’s point of view.
“Do you think you are hurt?”
“I was hurt. But we are not hurt.”
Sirone knew what the veteran’s words meant, so instead of approaching him, he made a hand trumpet and shouted.
“hey! What’s going on?”
The woman who was sitting in front of the wall of fire shouted.
“I was kidnapped by bandits! Please help me!”
“Is there a gang of bandits?”
Then it wasn’t safe here either.
“I’ll go and see.”
Lian approached the woman, with Austin taking cover with a fireball.
He was wearing a torn jacket, and there were many scratches from rolling down the mountain.
“What happened?”
The woman grabbed Lian’s crotch and said.
“I just barely got out! We must get out of here quickly! They will come after me!”
Sirone asked Austin as Lian looked back at the carriage as if to let him decide.
“Can I burn it with you?”
“Because you are the one who rented the wagon. But I wouldn’t recommend it.”
“Are you saying that woman is lying?”
“Things like that happen, too. But doubts don’t matter. I just want to tell you that if she doesn’t care whether what she says is true or false, nothing will happen to her.”
Maybe that’s the belief from the guild.
“But if there really is a group of bandits, shouldn’t we also avoid them?”
Austin had nothing to say about it.
“Lian!”
When Sirone gave a signal, Lian grabbed the woman’s hand and stood her up.
“First, get in the carriage. Let’s listen.”
“thank you! thank you!”
Shivering from the cold, the woman sadly shed tears.
