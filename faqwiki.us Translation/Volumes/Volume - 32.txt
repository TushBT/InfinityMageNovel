Upon arriving in Zion, Mei-Lei jumped out of bed, covered one ear and knelt down.
“Chief Justice.”
Terra Force, who was conducting a filibuster to prevent punishment for Shirone’s apostasy, received a call.
-The situation has been reversed.
“I heard.”
Nane’s sermon was imprinted on living beings throughout the universe through the law of the heart, quantum transmission.
Because it is a phenomenon that works in the mind, most of them do not even think that they have obtained information, but those who know the apostasy realized it.
‘Now I can abort.’
-Anker Ra, to be exact, Nane, who swallowed Ra’s dream, abrogated the third clause of the Three Absolute Principles.
“What will happen to Shirone?”
-Approve the apostasy. Of course, the same goes for Gaold. Of course, Terraforce’s judgment will continue. but… … .
The judge chose his words carefully.
-At that time, the judgment would have to be made with the death of the entire system, not the planet.
The end of the world was approaching.
“What am I supposed to do?”
-Help Zion and stop evil. A labyrinth will guide you. Lest the day come when Terraforce destroys the entire universe… … .
Communication was lost.
“You survived.”
Gaold’s group searched Jungcheon-dong for two days, but they couldn’t find Nane and Shura.
In the end, it was confirmed that he survived only after hearing a sermon on the way to Antarctica on a Kydra.
“But the Buddha is no more.”
Miro had a hunch that it was an opportunity.
“Assuming Shura is alive, finding Nane isn’t easy. But now you can finish the game. When we return to Zion, we will launch an all-out offensive against evil.”
If the altar is sealed and the atrocities are punished, the brilliant flowers of goodness will bloom again in the world.
said Zulu, seated in the Caydra’s c*ckpit.
“Yahweh will be in charge of sealing the altar, but apart from that, the demons are strong. It’s not an easy fight.”
Everyone but Miro looked back at Gaold.
‘Obviously the demons are strong. But if it’s Gaold… … .’
A magician who transcended ten thousand, a person who defeated Buddha was considered worthy of trying even an army of over 2 billion in hell.
‘If that’s the only problem… … .’
Sein took turns examining Gaold and Miro, who were coming in and out with an invisible line in between.
They hadn’t spoken a word since the battle, and now they didn’t even make eye contact.
‘It must be confusing.’
In the days when Miro handled everything, it was rather simple.
“But now the game has changed.’
Miro needs Gaold, and Gaold still loves Miro.
I wondered what it had to do with it.
‘Aren’t you heartless too?’
I don’t want to admit it, but in the end, the only remaining human in Miro’s mind was Gaold.
Miro felt Sain’s gaze, but ignored it until the end and threw her head back.
‘I’m really going crazy.’
Saying it’s someone else’s business and pushing it on the back.
Of course, Gaold was the only one who could be called a man to her, but he was a heart smaller than a speck.
The dust was so small that I didn’t even know if it was love, friendship, or sympathy.
‘I’d rather just date for a while then end it.’
Alpheas Magic School days.
It might have been possible if he accepted Gaold’s confession in the 6th level of the survival test, super fever.
‘Would the results have been different if I did?’
perhaps.
‘That’s why it’s getting complicated now.’
It would be better if Gaold had reached the current result while winning Miro’s love.
‘But if you accept him now… … .’
What about Gaold?
When he, who has endured with one mind for the labyrinth, finally wins it, the law that forms him collapses.
‘I could die. anyway… … .’
The strong spirit that can defeat even the Buddha will inevitably be dulled, and in the worst case, it will become a crippled person.
‘Do you know?’
Gaold would know.
‘That’s why he’s ignoring me too.’
After going through hell twice, he finally got over the maze, but still he got nothing.
‘Still, I’ll try to fight.’
Miro, who suddenly thought from Gaold’s point of view, looked up at the sky with sorrowful eyes.
‘Whether the world perishes or not, you don’t care.’
He was a person who would not regret spending the rest of his life with the woman he loved and leaving the world at any time.
‘It’s okay though. I’ll do it if you want.’
Isn’t the pain enough?
‘You’ve already done so much for the world. I’ll take care of you when you become a disabled person, and when you die, I’ll be buried next to you.’
However, Gaold’s choice was to stay by his side and fight for Miro until the end.
‘But you can’t love me anymore?’
I had been avoiding Gaold because I thought this situation would come, but it was finally time to make a decision.
“ha.”
Arius shook his shoulders at Miro’s sigh.
‘That poor human… … .’
* * *
“Shirone! Go out! Get ready!”
When Minerva invaded Shirone’s house, Shirone had already finished all preparations.
“what? Is it fast?”
Before he understood Nane’s sermon, he had already heard the situation from Taeseong.
‘Mr. Garold is back.’
I have transcended ten thousand, I have broken the Buddha, and I have allowed the apostasy, so there is no longer the master of the world.
Gaold’s shockwave caused a chain reaction to the law, eventually freeing Syrone from Terraforce’s judgment.
“This won’t be the end.”
Minerva nodded.
“The disappearance of Buddha is only the beginning. If there is no one right, there comes a world of chaos where anything is allowed.”
“The atrocities will become stronger.”
Minerva handed over the <Law Slaughter> documents.
“We have to block it. Let’s go to Kashan. Even if you use <Law Kill>, you cannot do it without the help of the Holy Temple.”
Since she intended to go to Uorin anyway, Shirone followed Minerva out without a word.
Just as they were about to escape from the magic circle on the first floor of the Ivory Tower to the Kingdom of Corona, four familiar people approached them.
‘People who play card games?’
Minerva raised an eyebrow.
“Oh my, what is this? Fossils that haven’t left the White Inn for 14 years are coming back here?”
said the bald old man, child.
“The game is over. To tell you the result.”
“Whoa, who’s the winner?”
said Gudio, who grew a red beard.
“The one who wants to keep the game.”
philanthropy.
Even though it was just a card game, it was not an unpleasant result in the face of a fierce battle.
“What are you going to do now?”
Said Ness, a man as bony as a skeleton.
“Reality has changed, so I’m going to run the simulation again. This time, the one who wants to end the game… … .”
“There’s a game that’s more fun than that. Do you want to go with me?”
For the law of <Slaughter> to aim precisely at the atrocities, those who played the card game were essential.
The man with the torn eye, Mais, asked.
“Is there a more fun gamble than this?”
“No matter how fun it is, it’s a simulation, right? Now I have to show my skills in the real game.”
“Which version is it?”
“To bankrupt those who must be robbed.”
“… … .”
Myers looked back at his colleagues and questioned their intentions, but Minerva already knew the outcome.
‘Because they… … .’
It’s because they’re really crazy about gambling.
“Is the stake enough?”
four people said at the same time.
* * *
Emperor Aganos of Kashan.
Uorin, who received the message around midnight, roamed the vast imperial palace nonstop from early morning.
‘Shirone is coming!’
with Minerva.
‘Of course, that woman.’
Uorin’s eyes, which had been recalled, narrowed.
‘It doesn’t matter. How long will I spend this time… … .’
It was not a wait that could be done with a human lifespan.
‘I can finally meet Shirone!’
Even though it was just a change of memory, it was no different from physical time to her, the person involved in the memory.
“Gando!”
The door opened immediately.
“Did you call?”
“The preparations are going without a hitch, right?”
“If you hadn’t called me 30 seconds ago, you should be checking by now.”
As long as there were no mistakes in welcoming Shirone, he knew that Uorin would not be angry today.
“Isn’t 30 seconds too harsh? Five minutes must have passed.”
“My pace is not that slow.”
True to its nickname, Urera, it was Gando who arrived by jumping through the 200-meter hallway in an instant.
“Anyway, fine.”
good anyway
“I need to put on makeup. Call the coordinator. I’ll just do it lightly. Lips a little redder… … .”
Gando was worried.
“The Empress is the strongest and most beautiful person in the world. He doesn’t see the need to do anything more.”
“What does it matter that I am beautiful? You should like Shirone. Call Cody.”
“The Empress.”
Gando risked his life.
“Are you really okay with this? I have never seen the Empress shaken like this.”
Uorin said as she changed her earrings.
“… … I know.”
“Don’t you know? Shirone is a necessary tool for the Empress’ daughter. If you love Shirone… … .”
yes let’s die here
“Will you become a daughter again and love your father?”
Gando sighed and closed his eyes, waiting for Uorin to sing a wind chime.
“It’s Gando.”
The name she called was Gando.
“Yes, as you said, Theraze is not an individual. history. But you know. Now, Syrone also came with that history.”
Gando did not want to hear.
‘Kill me! You must kill me, Empress!’
When the great history of Therazera is defined by a single human named Uorin, Kashan’s future is not guaranteed.
“At first, survival was the goal. However, from the moment Shirone occupied the beginning of my memory, I have been waiting for today to preserve history.”
Gando screamed evil.
“Kill! Just saying kill me… … !”
“Son.”
The moment Uorin’s words fell out, Gando couldn’t think of anything, as if he had been hit in the head with a hammer.
son.
I thought it was a word that didn’t exist in the world, so I didn’t even know what it felt like right now.
“Without Kashan, there is no Uorin. It is true that I am shaken, and I know that I will be criticized by the world. therefore… … .”
Uorin looked back at Gando and smiled sadly.
“Can’t we just cheer for Mom?”
Hot tears flowed silently down my cheeks as my heart skipped a beat.
“… … .”
Gando, who lowered his head and wiped away tears, spoke with an effort to hold on to his trembling voice.
“I will arrive in the evening. Get some sleep. I will proceed with the preparations without a hitch.”
“… … thanks.”
The door closed with a quiet sound.
In the room left alone after Gando had left, Uorin put her hand on the dressing table and looked in the mirror.
“I know.”
Theraze rose to the position of empress while endlessly analyzing the past based on the underlying incident.
“That’s how you came here.”
In the play time that was as long as history, the moment of enjoying an unexpected event was only a moment.
‘Once is enough for life.’
The reason I endured repeating the same incident, the same line, and the boring play as many times as the number of resets… … .
‘The only unknown left to me.’
It was for the most brilliant event in Theraje’s life.

[777] chain action(3)
* * *
Upon arriving in Zion, Miro held a meeting between the monks representing each denomination.
Now that the Buddha is away, it is a golden opportunity to attack evil, and the work will have to be done quickly and strategically.
It took a lot of time because it was the first step in an endless war.
In the meantime, Gaold’s party heard about Shion and reunited with Armin and Kuan.
“Is the author Gaold?”
All of the monks’ attention was on Gaold.
‘The human who defeated the Buddha.’
Miro will listen to it anyway, but the young children couldn’t control their curiosity.
Although the power of the law is strong because there is no cloudiness in their hearts, they are in the process of learning in the realm.
“What is enlightenment higher than Buddha?”
At first, Gaold did not pretend to listen, but as the number continued to increase, he eventually stopped walking.
‘Start!’
It was so quiet that I couldn’t even hear my breathing.
“Sit on the toilet and strain your stomach.”
When Gaold’s voice was heard, the monks listened as if they would not miss a single Tosi.
“What comes out of that is enlightenment.”
As Gaold, who had turned away coldly, moved away, the children all tilted their heads and exchanged opinions.
“This is a very difficult line.”
The bald-headed child rested his chin on his chin and muttered.
“Hmm, sit on the toilet and strain your stomach. What comes out of it is enlightenment… … .”
He raised his head and sighed.
“poop?”
Enlightenment is shit.
“Maybe this is what it means? Treat enlightenment like shit. In other words, don’t be obsessed.”
In any case, it was a message from someone who defeated Buddha, so they were trying to think in a positive way.
“okay. Send out the enlightenment in your heart like shit, and you will gain true enlightenment.”
The children were amazed.
“Oh, Ming’s insight is excellent. indeed… … Are you saying that you have to abandon the Buddha in order to accept the Buddha?”
Gangnan, who was lost in thought at the sound of the students of each denomination, asked Gaold.
“What are you talking about?”
Gaold spat out in annoyance.
“What is it? It means go and poop.”
“Ahahaha!”
Gangnan’s laughter embroidered the cold sky.
“huh? Why are you like that?”
As the children looked back at Gangnan at the same time, Zion’s leading figure, Lilia, approached.
“Mr. Gaold was playing a joke.”
He was a Totemist of the Achaeans who sealed Optrus together with Dante in the old castle ruins.
“joke? You mean you lied?”
When the monks looked back at Gaold with a look on their faces, Lilia smiled and said,
“It doesn’t matter. What really matters is that you have enlightened Mr. Garold’s words.”
“… … .”
“Enlightenment is not grandiose or fancy. You can finally see something that was there originally.”
Breathing is a huge realization for a child of jinan.
“Since Mr. Gaold already knows, it doesn’t matter whether you lie or tell the truth.”
In the end, the Dao leads to one.
“Enlightenment is shit… … .”
As the monks looked back at Gaold in awe, Lilia avoided her seat.
‘It will be a great power to the world.’
With such thoughts in mind, I went into the simple temple prepared in Zion, and a maze came out after the meeting.
“You worked hard, Mr. Miro.”
Miro was also politely greeted.
“yes. What about Gaold?”
“I went back to my house a little while ago. He was a strong man. The power of evil will be weaker in the future.”
Miro sighed softly.
“Are you worried about anything?”
“That’s true… … .”
Thinking that this is not something to talk about here, Miro took Lyria’s hand and went to a quiet place.
Miro had no reason to reveal her true feelings to others, but Gaold’s problem was an exception.
‘If it’s Lyria-san… … .’
Most of the monks in Zion were people close to the polar line, so there was nothing to hold back.
“okay.”
Lillia, who heard the circumstances of the two people’s identity, nodded her head with a sad expression.
“Do you feel guilty?”
“I don’t know. Because this problem is so complex. I need Gaold’s help, but I don’t think it’s anything like this.”
“of course.”
Lyria was adamant.
“The reason why good differs from evil is that it is not cowardly. I think Mr. Miro should speak.”
The darkness lifted from Miro’s face.
“Of course, these words are from a third person… … .”
“No, I need to go see Gaold now.”
Lyria smiled and shrugged her arms.
“have a great time.”
No matter how much you fight for the world, how can you be called a human being without love?
“Thank you, Mr. Lyria.”
After Miro left, she crossed her legs and rested her chin on the table, which became quiet.
“Ha, I want to date too.”
Dante’s face came to mind in her mind, who had never met a man properly because she had been chasing evil all her life.
‘I must have already forgotten. Are you living well?’
“Yes, I am going. Go straight.”
There’s nothing to worry about having already made a decision, but Miro’s heart pounded as he walked to Gaold’s quarters.
“I can’t stand it because it’s frustrating.”
I will openly confide in you and let you decide whether to choose yourself or the world.
‘And if you choose me… … .’
Miro’s face grew hot as he stopped walking.
‘But what if I’m very strange?’
It is said that sharing love can be done according to your feelings, but it was the first time in your life to honestly reveal it.
The more I tried this and that simulation, the more irritated Maze started to walk again.
‘I don’t know! I just need to turn off the lights!’
When Gaold finally arrived, he saw Gangnan, Zulu, Armin, and Sain gathered in front of Gaold’s accommodation.
“huh? what’s the matter?”
“Mr. Miro.”
Armin scratched his head with a puzzled expression.
“Why are you gathering here? Gaold?”
Sein said.
“They say they are leaving now. I’m packing up.”
Miro opened her eyes wide.
“this time? Where are you going?”
“Battlefield.”
It seemed Gaold had already made up his mind before Miro presented his options.
“It’s because of you.”
Kang Nan opened his eyes and said.
“You didn’t say a warm word to me all the way here. How can you be so selfish? Is that the line you are talking about?”
Good is good, love is love.
“Where are you dating someone out of mercy? I’m doing what I feel too. Besides, wouldn’t it be much better for you if I didn’t choose Gaold?”
“Kuk!”
When Gangnan couldn’t refute and bit his lip, Miro closed his eyes and regretted his mistake.
‘This is why I hate feelings.’
Contrary to belief, it makes everything unknown.
“Sorry. i know i’m bad But now I’ve made up my mind. Let me tell you.”
Miro grabbed the doorknob and said.
“every… … Would you mind avoiding your seat?”
That explanation was enough, and when Kang Nan turned around with a sad expression, others followed her.
“Whoa.”
Miro, who had calmed down, opened the door to see Gaold packing his bag.
“What, without knocking?”
“Hmph, it doesn’t matter what you were doing!”
Gaold packed his bags and put them on the bed.
“Don’t try. you have work to do Just do it without thinking about anything.”
Miro asked, closing the door with her back.
“Then what about you?”
“… … .”
“You’re going to keep fighting for me like that? in terrible pain? So what’s left?”
“It’s not your fault.”
Gaold met his eyes for the first time.
“It’s not your fault that I’m sick or that I’m like this. throw me out of your mind Then you can be perfect.”
“So you ask! How are you?”
“I’m fine.”
Gaold’s gaze was warm.
“It’s different from the past when I couldn’t do anything. I can fight for you now You just have to punish the evil of the world.”
Miro couldn’t contain his emotions.
“… … What if I die then?”
I couldn’t stop the tears from flowing.
“Then what if you die? If you suffer like that all your life and then die, what is your life like? Where the hell is that life?”
“I will not die.”
Even his smile looked painful.
“Until you smile happily and look at me, I will never die.”
Miro sat on the bed and gently cupped Gaold’s hair with both hands.
‘Yes, that’s right.’
Gaold was such a person.
‘A follower of the Jordanian religion.’
An innocent young man who just wanted everyone’s heart to be filled with love.
‘I should have known.’
However, only that young man with no talent endured the heat of hell and confessed to Miro.
‘I should have known at least then.’
I should have known that on the day she said goodbye to the world, when she shouted Miro’s name to the end even as her limbs were torn.
‘How stupid am I?’
Why did you think this man was an idiot?
He was the one who rescued him from heaven after fighting for 20 years in terrible pain.
‘Kill God… … .’
kill again
‘Kill again!’
Having defeated even Buddha, he now says he will kill all the evil in the world for the woman he loves.
“Because that is you.”
Miro cradled Gaold’s face in her arms and burst into tears.
“Because I am the strongest person in the world!”
therefore.
“Until this war is over, I… … .”
Miro looked up at the ceiling and said
“I will never love you. I will completely erase you from my mind.”
In Maze’s arms, Gaold said
“… … okay.”
“I promise you instead.”
Miro sat down and caressed Gaold’s cheek.
“If I can’t love you, I won’t love anyone else. No one will ever have my heart.”
therefore.
“It’s nice to meet someone else. For a woman like me, if you want to give up, give up anytime. If you can be happy even for a moment, grab that happiness without worrying. Promise!”
“… … okay.”
If you can erase me with it
“Gaold. Gaold… … .”
Miro, who had pityfully stroked Gaold, who had her eyes closed, ran out of the room wiping away tears.
After hearing the door slam shut, Gaold slowly raised his eyelids.
For a moment, the feeling of sadness rose as if it would explode, but soon it cooled down like an unexploded bullet.
“It is enough to end the war.”
only for her
Entering a simple purpose, Gaold rose from his seat like a machine and slung his bag over his shoulder.
It was dawn before I knew it, and when I went outside, a chill that seemed to freeze my breath entered my nostrils.
“… … .”
In the middle of the glacier, Zulu and Gangnan, who were ready to depart, were waiting under the lights that were turned on.
Gaold approached them and said.
“It’s my fight from now on.”
Gangnan pursed his lips.
“When wasn’t that? Ugly anyway… … .”
ducklings.
Gaold smiled and patted Gangnan on the shoulder and approached Zulu, who had Caidra on standby.
“Where is the fiercest?”
Zulu answered as he heard.
“Shirt.”
The power of the demons was not particularly strong, but it was an area where the power of mankind was relatively weak.
“Right.”
Gaold looked back and said.
“Let’s go, mutt.”
Kang Nan, who exudes the fighting spirit of a Ram Muay warrior, strode forward, raising the corners of his mouth.
“Are you sure it’s clean?”
No matter who loved whom, she was the only one who could cross the river of death with Gaold.

[778] chain action(4)
* * *
near midnight.
All districts of Aganos, the imperial castle of Kashan, were lit up and festivals were in full swing in the streets.
‘Kashan of the night.’
The scene of the city emitting huge energy was like seeing an unknown civilization hidden deep in the universe.
Shirone, who was flying next to Jet, asked.
“Are you going straight this time?”
Minerva was lost in thought as a row of card players sat behind Jett.
‘The circumstances are different from Nam Eymond.’
If it was the five great stars of the Ivory Tower, there would be no reason to notice Kashan, but Uo-Lin was a special opponent.
‘Mitochondrial Eve… … .’
Her influence in reading the world situation through history search is the best among the Three Emperors.
She was also the head of the Valkyries, an anti-heaven unit, and even in the holy war, there was an atmosphere that recognized her as an implicit leader.
“Kashan’s army doesn’t need to be considered. The problem is the world famous Aganos Guards.”
Minerva spread three fingers.
“This is the iron rule. Yuan (遠), which protects the building of the Empress, Zhong (Zhong), which protects the Queen’s space, and Geun (近), which protects the life of the Empress
“It means that there is a circle outside the imperial castle, a middle inside the imperial castle, and a root in the layer where Wurin stays.”
Minerva asked for the pipe.
“The Aganos Guards-near. They say even the skills of ordinary members are comparable to that of a general. If you invade our territory, we will attack you.”
It was a position that Uorin had requested, but unless there were special instructions, the guards had no choice but to draw their swords.
“Get off in front of the imperial castle. That would be nice.”
“You are misunderstanding something. I mean, it’s not an easy opponent, so smash it from the start. Let’s go straight to the queen’s room like this.”
Shirone’s eyes narrowed.
“Why are people so twisted?”
“I always say… … .”
An explosion erupted from the ejection port of the jet.
“You are you, I am me!”
Power entered Minerva’s eyes as she rushed through the air at terrifying speed.
‘It must have fooled me.’
At the time, I never thought it would be Theraje.
‘Oh, is it quiet?’
Although it was already time for the Aganos Guards to act, there was no sign of anything on the ground.
“Wait a minute!”
Shirone hurriedly followed and shouted, but the more he did, the more fire rose inside.
‘I don’t know what you’re thinking, but I saw the wrong person!’
Jets shot like arrows as Minerva and the card players floated in the air.
The walls exploded with a roar.
“Really, why are you like that?”
Shirone spat out annoyedly, but it was too late to turn the situation around.
“Hmm.”
Minerva, who entered the castle through the collapsed wall, pulled out the jet embedded in the floor.
“Is anyone there?”
Shirone, who had followed the people playing the card game, held out her hand.
“Wait a minute. Maybe this isn’t it… … .”
Then Gando opened the door and came in.
“You are here. The Empress is waiting for you.”
Even the imperial castle items were destroyed due to trespassing, but nothing was said about it.
“what? Where are the guards going?”
“There were special instructions. It is an order to make sure there is no inconvenience in serving guests.”
If it was an empire other than Kashan, the hospitality would have been considered excessive, but the opponent was Mitochondrial Eve.
‘Is this also a design?’
Minerva, recalling her memories of the past, licked her lips and moved on, and Gando guided them.
The place they arrived at was a room in a completely different location from when Shirone had come before.
“Here you are, Shirone.”
Uorin was waiting with her hands folded in the crystal-lit room.
“… … .”
Minerva opened her mouth, and the people playing the card game watched in awe.
She was wearing light makeup, a red ribbon tied around her neck, and a black dress that matched her white hair.
“pretty.”
Shirone knew for the first time that there was anything so pretty in the world.
‘Nice job, Gando.’
When Uorin’s eyes were filled with joy that he couldn’t hide, Gando let out a sigh of relief.
‘Now the Empress takes care of it.’
The prettiest thing in Gando’s eyes is also the prettiest thing in Shirone’s eyes.
On the other hand, disbelief lingered in Minerva’s eyes.
‘what’s this? Why is this?’
Her mind was confused by the disposition so different from the Theraze she knew.
‘It’s like… … .’
Isn’t that what a woman in love looks like?
‘It’s not strange that Theraze wants Shirone.’
However, if it was really urgent, it was only necessary to extract the seeds by force, regardless of means and methods.
‘The choice to gain through love is too inefficient. No, efficiency or something has no meaning to Theraze.’
Shirone said.
“Sorry for making a fuss. I wanted to come in quietly.”
“are you okay. Because I already knew and prepared for it.”
When he heard that Minerva was coming, Uorin saw that she might ruin the whole board.
“As expected, it’s Uorin. You look really pretty today.”
Uorin was so dizzy that she lost consciousness.
‘What do we do? Worse than expected?’
His unrequited love was to the extent of it, and he was a person who had been in his heart ever since he was a primitive man.
My desire grew so great that it overpowered my reason, and my body felt so hot that I felt as if I had turned into a beast.
Minerva smiled and approached.
“Long time no see, sister.”
“Ugh.”
At the words of pouring cold water on the hot heat, Uorin’s expression crumpled at once.
“sister?”
Tilting her head and thinking, Shirone recalled the contents of Uorin’s letter and realized.
‘Come to think of it… … .’
Minerva pointed at Uorin.
“Sure, sister. No, should I call you a senior? Because she is the one who taught me the joys of witches.”
Theraze lived a life of a witch before becoming Empress of Kashan, but Uorin didn’t want to bring it out.
“Because it is part of history. But as you know, Theraze isn’t one person, right? You should know that your senior, Theraze, is no longer in the world.”
“It’s good, it’s comfortable.”
Theraze endlessly changed her body through generations, but Minerva’s body remained the same as when she was a witch.
Uorin noticed.
“I’m sorry about that time. But I didn’t lead them to witches, they met by chance… … .”
“Ho Ho! right! then we met there I remember now.”
Sitting on Shirone’s shoulder, Minerva looked at Uorin and whispered in his ear.
“Do you know what a great witch Theraze was? She must have been named Electra or something. Right?”
“Hey, can we talk about the old days later?”
Minerva pretended not to hear.
“I learned a lot by working with my sister. Because I was surprised. One day with close to 100 men at once… … .”
Minerva’s eyes fluttered with excitement.
“… … .”
Uorin, who tried to twitch her lips, was weeping with her reddened eyes.
Lives rose from Gando’s body.
‘Should I kill him?’
Maybe I should call a wind chime.
“Uorin, are you okay?”
Just as Shirone held out her hand, Uorin twisted her body and ran out of the room.
Shirone, who had been staring blankly at that scene, looked back at Minerva with a furrowed brow.
“Why do you keep talking nonsense? The person said he didn’t want to hear it.”
“What am I? If the person in question wants to say something, they can do it. Is it true anyway?”
Shirone, who could understand Minerva’s feelings, couldn’t go deeper.
Gando raised his chin and approached.
“You must have made up your mind and made fun of it, right?”
“Why don’t you find a place to intervene and join in, kid? Anyway, appease your queen and bring her. Because we have work to do.”
“I’ll go.”
Shirone looked back at Gando.
“Take him to Uorin. It happened because of me.
Gando was lost in thought
‘If you consider the empress as dirty… … .’
At that time, Kashan will mobilize all the power that Minerva has to wipe it out of this world.
“Please pick me up.”
He stared into Shirone’s eyes and then turned around.
‘I’m not that kind of person.’
It was a fact that I realized from the first time we met at the Tormia Magic Association.
“Follow me. You will be in the annex.”
In front of Uorin’s room, which was guided by Gando, Shirone knocked slowly on the door.
“Uorin, are you in?”
No answer was heard.
“I’ll go in for a minute.”
Shirone nodded to Gando and opened the door, blinking her eyes while holding the doorknob.
Uorin was sitting cross-legged on the bed, smiling and beckoning.
“ah… … .”
When Shirone, conscious of Gando, hurriedly closed the door and entered, Uorin got up from the bed.
“Welcome. Sit here.”
“Are you feeling a little better?”
“at all. I really hate that girl. But it’s not like she doesn’t understand.”
Uorin suggested a drink.
“drink. I didn’t take the sleeping pills, so don’t worry.”
I was finally relieved.
“Actually, I wasn’t cold-hearted either. I was so emotional at the thought of meeting you. Minerva made me cold.”
“Then why did you leave crying?”
“There’s something I want to talk about just the two of us.”
As Shirone put down her glass and waited, Uorin looked away and said,
“Would you like to make love with me here and now?”
“Uorin, that’s… … .”
“I know. There’s someone else on your mind And that heart will never change, don’t you think?”
Shirone honestly nodded.
“I also have a great responsibility called Kashan. So let’s make love here. It can end everything.”
“I can’t. that… … .”
It would be a betrayal of Amy.
“I am speaking for you.”
Uorin met Shirone’s eyes.
“I can’t tell you, but I know how you must love me. And if I use this method, you have to be my man whether you like it or not.”
I thought there was no case where the heart was robbed.
“Gando worries about me. But i’m not worried I’ve prepared for a long time, and the way to win your heart is already perfectly established in my head.”
Since it was the words of Mitochondrial Eve, the designer of history, it could not be dismissed as bluffing.
“Eventually I will have you. no matter how sad you are rather want it So this is the final favor of my feelings. If you love me just for today, I will let you go too.”
When Shirone was silent, Uorin added.
“To be clear, not twice. This is your last chance to love Amy.”
last chance.
‘I’m going to choose Uorin?’
I couldn’t even guess what the reason was, but I wouldn’t tell you anyway.
“Nothing will change.”
Shirone was adamant.
“I don’t want to hurt Amy. It doesn’t matter if I really love you, but other than that I’ll never change my mind.”
“… … okay.”
Woorin closed her eyes.
‘It turns out like this after all.’
Even if the lower case is useless during the Great Purification Period, Mitochondrial Eve’s vision is different from that of humans.
If you integrate all the events that have happened so far, you can vaguely predict what will happen in the future.
Above all, Uorin was a human with the most powerful vision of the future among Theraze.
“Okay, Shirone.”
Wu Lin smiled.
“Let’s go out. I have to work now.”
In the end, Shirone would be held in her arms, so Uorin was happy to let him go with a smile.

[779] Justice of Evil (1)
When Shirone and Uorin returned to the room, Minerva was putting the <Law Kill> on the table.
To her right sat the card players—Gudio, Agaya, Ness, and Mays, in that order.
“Are you feeling a little calmer?”
When Minerva smiled and said it wasn’t her fault, Uorin responded with a smile.
“sorry. You showed an ugly side to your immature younger brother.”
After confirming Shirone’s heart, there was no reason to be shaken by Minerva anymore.
‘There was something.’
Mitochondrial Eve’s field of vision far transcends that of ordinary people, so Minerva stopped thinking of digging into it.
“Let’s talk about work. As promised, I brought you the <Law Kill>. Now tell me how you will punish the atrocities.”
Uorin looked at the people playing the card game and gave a meaningful smile.
“Great people have come.”
There was no way that Uorin didn’t know the faces of the four best gamblers in the world.
‘Even the ivory tower is paying attention. If they are, they will be of great help in dealing with <Law Killing>.’
As Shirone took a seat next to Minerva, Gando turned the car around and Urin sat down for the last time.
“As you may already have guessed, the atrocity I point out is Gustav Habitz, the emperor of the Gustav Empire.”
The eyes of the people playing the card game narrowed.
“The Gustav Empire has already finished preparing for war. A world war will break out in the next 48 hours.”
Some aristocrats near the border had already arranged their property and fled to other countries.
Uorin unfolded the world map.
“The beginning of the war will be here, the Republic of Korea.”
The Republic of Korea, a peninsula protruding from the northern continent toward the Pacific Ocean, was crushed by the Gustav Empire.
“Gustav cannot be expanded without destroying the Republic of Korea. Of course, it should have already been eaten, but… … .”
said Minerva.
“Ancient weapon Ex-Machina.”
“okay. I’ll explain later, but that’s why Gustav hasn’t invaded the Republic of Korea so far. But in the event of an all-out war, occupation is only a matter of time.”
Shirone asked.
“What is the judgment of the Republic of Korea?”
“No official statement was made. He’s probably weighing the temple and Gustaf. Depending on which side you join, the fate of your country will be different.”
Minerva snorted.
“If it were me, of course I would join the Gustav Empire. It’s too geographically inconvenient. While Valkyrie goes to support, her country must already be in ruins.”
“It’s the same idea. So, of course, they are proceeding with alliance negotiations behind the scenes. The only problem is, if Havitz is truly atrocious, there’s no way he’ll accept the offer.”
“In the end, the key is Havitz. Are you saying that it is better to punish the atrocities as soon as possible before the damage of war increases?”
“that’s right. That’s why you need <Slaughter>.”
Harvits has broken the perfectly interlocking three-legged structure, killing him will restore the balance.
Wuolin looked back at the people playing the card game.
“What you have to do is to design a law that will surely kill Habitz through <Law Killing> ability. Humans, emotions, funds, culture, laws, any part can be changed. All support will come from the temple.”
“It won’t be easy.”
Gudio spoke, and the card players remained silent as if they agreed.
“That’s natural. Because it kills the emperor. That’s why I called you, the best gamblers in the world.”
“Not the best in the world.”
Mais looked at Uorin with torn eyes.
“I don’t think anyone knows how we met and why we came to the Ivory Tower.”
“What are you talking about?”
Agaya, the bald old man, said.
“Yeah, at one time it was the best in the world. But we have something in common. That I lost to the same person 14 years ago.”
It was the first time Minerva had heard of it.
“You lost? to whom?”
The skeletal Ness’ face darkened even more.
“Now it seems to be called Gustav 4th Art. God of War, Vulcan.”
Uorin recalled the impression of being rambunctious like a Balkan bandit he had seen in the temple.
“What is the odds of winning?”
Gudio said.
“There is no such thing as a win rate. Because I couldn’t win a game. In any event, the rules for winners and losers are divided, and Balkans do not lose.”
I didn’t think there could be that much of a difference.
“How is that possible? No matter how good a gambler you are, you can’t break the odds.”
Agaya shook her head.
“I don’t know. I calculated it perfectly, but when the game is over, I feel possessed. It feels like he alone knows the rules of the game.”
“It’s not a chance.”
Ness, who returned from the shock of 14 years ago flowing backwards through the years, said with strained eyes.
“He reads the military flag.”
Also called mob.
Imperial Castle of the Gustav Empire, Marshak.
One of the largest artificial structures in the world along with Jincheon’s Yeomra and Kashan’s Aganos.
While each department was busy preparing for war, only the military Balkans were quietly playing chess.
Hundreds of chessboards were connected into one.
“What are you doing? Leave it soon!”
The 23 soldiers of the Empire facing the Balkans suffered from headaches while looking at the location of over 2,000 horses.
‘I don’t know. What should I move?’
In a game of chess, whether you win or lose, there is always a winning trend.
Just by moving the first word, future possibilities drop exponentially.
‘But when hundreds of plates are connected… … .’
It goes over to the realm of senses that cannot be calculated with the human mind, and the standard of probability is lost.
“Let’s move this.”
After discussion, 23 people moved the pawn on the chess board at position 127 by 278.
‘I do not know.’
A piece can use all of the connected chessboards, so I wasn’t sure if my choice was the right one.
“It is a foolish judgment.”
The soldiers flinched at Balkan’s words.
“If we respond like this, isn’t there a way?”
The bishop on the chessboard numbered 7 horizontally and 16 vertically, which seemed to have nothing to do with the soldiers moving their pieces, moved.
‘I never know. What the hell does that have to do with it?’
In the future, if the horses moved about 2,000 more times, something might be seen, but the number of cases that the military and Balkans could choose until they reached 2,000 were infinite.
‘Prediction is impossible. It’s not a matter of calculation, it’s completely open to probability. It’s just the beginning.’
But how come he never won?
‘In the end, the game ends according to the general commander’s words.’
The soldiers looked at the Balkans, blessed by the gods of both Munmun and Wumu, with fearful eyes.
‘In his eyes… … What do you see?’
At the edge of hundreds of boards, Vulcan sat cross-legged and looked down at the battlefield.
‘That place is weak.’
He could clearly see the golden melody swirling through the thousands of words.
The soldiers moved their words to a point where the light was particularly weak in the light that filled the board.
“It is a weak judgment.”
Servants can also calculate the entire arrangement of pieces.
‘It would be easier if I gave up.’
Discipline denies probabilities.
It is not the form that the military discipline sees, but the gaze of the crowd that changes every moment due to its form.
“Let’s stop. You guys have already lost.”
What the military flag conveyed through the location of the horses moved by the soldiers was the reverence for the Balkans.
“What about the emperor?”
“Ah, from what I heard, a walk in the compound… … .”
“I’m bored to death.”
Vulcan said with a yawn.
“Why is the day so long today?”
Shirone asked.
“Are you such a difficult opponent?”
People who play card games answered unanimously.
“It is difficult.”
Agaya raised her index finger.
“Crowd Air is not an objective probability, but rather a peak of relative response. In other words, no one wins in a game with an opponent. If such a person is next to Havitz, he should be able to respond sufficiently to the law of <Slaughter>.”
“But also… … .”
said Ness.
“That’s why an enemy worth defeating. We will definitely win this gamble.”
The fighting spirit of those who played the card game flared up.
“good. So now let’s get into the analysis. First of all, we need to know who we will be dealing with.”
Uorin looked back at Shirone.
“villainy. Have you ever met them in your life?”
“Hmm, well? I’ve met quite a few bad people… … .”
Minerva pointed to herself.
“me?”
“It’s not atrocious.”
Uorin shook her head.
“Of course, Minerva, you’re a really bad girl, but atrocities aren’t something that’s expressed to such an extent.”
Minerva pursed her lips.
“So you probably don’t want to hear… … .”
this is the story.
“I’d like to avoid it for the rest of my life.”
It is a story about the most distant human beings in the world, about atrocities.
* * *
“Help me! Her husband is dying!”
In the commoners’ quarters of the imperial castle, Marshak, a woman was out on the street and screaming.
“What is it?”
The man who ran in hastily was an old man in his 50s dressed as a clown with a drum on his back.
“Ah, that… … .”
The woman who was about to ask for help frowned when she saw the man dressed as a drug dealer.
“Someone please help! my husband… … !”
She couldn’t recognize the face of Zetaro, one of the four Gustav artists.
“So tell me! After all, I learned medicine. Shouldn’t people be saved?”
Zetaro was the most outstanding doctor in the Empire.
“Can you really save it?”
It wasn’t a matter to jump on without confidence, so the woman decided to trust Zetaro’s words.
“Here, here it is. I suddenly burst into foam and collapsed.”
Her husband was lying on the floor, and her little daughter and son were crying on the stairs.
“I’ll take a look first.”
Zetaro, who looked at her husband’s complexion and pupil’s reaction, recognized the symptoms at once.
“Basquiat Virus. Have you been to the lake in the past two months?”
“yes? Ah yes! I once went fishing with my friends!”
Zetaro rummaged through the merchant’s bag and pulled out a vial containing a brown liquid.
“This drug… … .”
“Can you live by drinking it?”
“No, this is my drug. I have some chronic illnesses.”
The woman looked at Zetaro, who opened the lid of the vial and gulped down the medicine, in bewilderment.
“Please save my husband! Can you save it?”
“It’s the Basquiat virus. The cure is… … .”
Zetaro, who hesitated while taking out a scalpel, bit his lip and suddenly shouted.
“How do I know that!”
As he looked up at the ceiling with blood vessels in his eyes, he hacked at her husband’s chest with a scalpel.
“Kaaaaa!”
The woman screamed and the children rolled their eyes and fainted at the sight of blood oozing out.
“Wait, what the heck… … what are you doing… … .”
Zetaro, who had already been vaccinated, went outside with a bowl of hot blood on his face.
“Hey, Jetaro. I’m hungry. Would you like to go get something to eat?”
Havits in shabby clothes and Natasha in a suit approached, accompanied by the guards.
“Your Majesty, another life has been lost. So, so sad… … .”
Jetaro was unable to speak due to the unbearable sadness.
“I will sing a song.”
Hopping with his left foot and pushing his right foot to beat the drum, he held the trumpet and blew.
“Turbab Ddudu. Tur bab bab tu.”
The sound of the trumpet played by the best singer in the empire rang the heartstrings of passers-by.
“You bad children! What are you doing after killing your husband? … !”
When the woman came out of the house with a knife, the guards immediately pinned her to the ground.
“Aww! He is the emperor!”
People who had been watching the performance in a state of fascination realized the situation and left.
“Puhahaha! Fuhahaha!”
Havitz, who found the current situation so funny, was holding his belly button and bursting into laughter.

“If it is man who defines good and evil, then who is good and who is evil?”
Wu Lin continued.
“How do you know? 100 goodness calls 10 good bad, and 10 evil calls 1?? bad bad.”
The world seems to be full of bad guys.
“You are only right. The moment you realize that you can never be right, you will lean from neutral to good… … .”
Intelligence.
“That doesn’t mean enlightened people don’t do bad things.”
Therefore, human life is a tragedy when seen from close up and a comedy when seen from afar.
“Then, what about the evil gaze? If you look at human life from the farthest distance… … .”
If you look at the farthest from human beings, our lives can’t find any logic or probability.
“It’s just a F*cking comedy.”
* * *
“Puhaha! It was great! It’s also Jetaro! I deserve the title of Gustav 4th skill!”
Havitz couldn’t stop laughing.
“A person has died. But what do you mean laugh? Stop taking care of yourself.”
As Zetaro turned his face, Harbitz’s laughter stopped.
“… … .”
Natasha, who was caught in the middle, smiled, rolling her large, severed eyelids.
“Puhahaha! That’s really funny! The best comedian! Isn’t that right, Natasha?”
“There is no question.”
Zetaro held back laughter until the end.
‘Those who want to make others laugh must not laugh themselves.’
Gustav 4th class, Rosica Zetaro.
Although he has the ability of a doctor, a master craftsman, and a comedian, he has a different reason for Havitz’s liking for him.
“Zeta is fun.”
Because it resembles you the most.
“Hey, sumodo! Come here quickly! What Zetaro did today… … .”
Upon arriving at the imperial castle, Sumodo came out to meet him.
“That is not the problem now. Aren’t you going to play Republic of Korea? I’m bored with Balkan right now, so I’m going to die.”
Harvits dismounted.
“You haven’t hit yet? hit it now War is what the Balkans enjoy the most, so you can do it yourself, right?”
“Even so, I put one bag in. I’ll see you soon. We will capture the city of Pasipah, close to the border.”
“The Vulcan sent it, so we should win. do it yourself. You take care of the loot yourself.”
“That loot. The military will take care of the women, but I want them to be called in to some extent and sold to the public for money.”
“why? Are you out of money? Can I steal it from another country?”
“Young guys want to go to the battlefield after having some fun, don’t they? Domesticating slaves and distributing the money to households could raise taxes.”
Harvits gave a thumbs up.
“As expected, my king. Ah, come to think of it, Zetaro killed one person while performing. Select 10 handsome and strong guys and send them to the woman. Worth more than her husband. Give me about 100 million gold.”
“All right.”
* * *
Uorin patted his head.
“All they have in their heads is how to make themselves happy.”
Other people’s feelings are not included.
“Killing people, hurting others. All can be said to be evil. But that is not the definition of evil.”
what is evil
“Ignorance.”
According to Uorin’s definition.
“It doesn’t mean that I am stupid or unlearned. Because we don’t know what is right, there is no standard for judgment.”
So, ignorance is chaos.
“Of course I have no guilt. They don’t even know that they are evil. The function of <Law Kill> is excellent, but it is quite difficult to squeeze into this gap.”
It must be because it is outside the law.
* * *
“Are you really going to do this? If it comes out like this, I can turn it all upside down.”
Ardakh, the Vice Minister of Environment of the Gustav Empire, had a hobby of making maids into debt on purpose and dragging them into bed.
“Don’t keep doing this. I told you no.”
However, Marie was not caught.
“Come on? good is good Think of your old mother at home. Can you cure the disease?”
It was because countless maids had already told Marie of the humiliation and humiliation suffered by Ardakh.
“I don’t need that kind of money. It is also her family’s business that her mother is sick. Because I’ll earn it… … .”
“Such a cheap thing!”
Ardak yelled and raised her hand, and Marie shrank with a frightened expression.
“You know how I can’t do something like you? I am the Minister of Environment. Shall I hang myself in the plaza right now?”
Gustav’s nominee was a tyrant for generations, and it wasn’t even about killing a lady-in-waiting at the vice-minister level.
“Sal, please save me.”
“Then borrow money. Understand? Let’s do it legally, legally. You are good and I am good.”
the guards shouted.
“Please, Your Majesty the Emperor!”
Ardakh, who shook his shoulders, quickly stepped back, and the maid next to him bowed her head side by side.
“Yes, yes, there are many hardships.”
Harvits, still wearing shabby clothes, approached the deputy minister scratching his groin.
“What are you doing here? Hmm.”
The lady-in-waiting frowned for a moment, then met Havitz’s eyes and her face turned pale.
“ah… … sorry.”
As Harvits reached out, Zetaro took out a hatchet from his bag and handed it to him.
The moment the handmaid’s heart sank, Havits struck down the hatchet and drove it into Ardak’s skull.
“Justice done.”
“Queueex!”
As the ax blade hit the crown of his head, eyeballs flew out of Ardak’s screaming eyes.
“Huh! Whoops!”
While the terrified maid was breathing heavily, Natasha opened one dangling eyeball.
“… … .”
After rolling her eyes with her fingers for a moment, she put it in her mouth and sucked the blood from the other side.
“eye.”
He half-pushed his eyeballs out between his lips and turned his head, and Havis burst out laughing.
“Live happily. Give him 100 million gold too.”
He tapped the lady-in-waiting on the shoulder, and Havits passed by, and Natasha followed and spit out her eyeballs.
“Hey, you’ve gotten stronger.”
As Natasha turned the corner with her arms raised, the lady-in-waiting sat down and vomited.
“Wow! Wow!”
* * *
“Evil comes from ignorance.”
It was no coincidence that wizards, a symbol of intellect for generations, were the pinnacle of their time.
“Nevertheless, in some cases, evil looks attractive. Like a good person or a bad person. Humans are creatures of illusion, so once you’re good, you see bad things as good, but… … .”
Wu Lin shrugged.
“Actually, there is no such thing. Good deeds and bad deeds are just fragments of chaos.”
Shirone asked.
“How could such a person exist?”
“Because it is extreme. If you think about it that way, the polar line is also bizarre. Your philanthropy and mine are the directions that are the furthest away from humans.”
said Minerva.
“Something like childhood trauma?”
If you find the cause of the present Havitz, you will be able to find a strategy.
“I analyzed it by history search, but it is estimated that there are few.”
Ness asked.
“Does that mean there are few or not at all?”
“When Havitz was three years old, it was the time when he was interested in the human body. I once stabbed her maid in the eyes and blinded her.”
“… … .”
“As a tyrant for generations, Gustav’s genes are violent, but it’s not without the influence of the environment. If the maid had removed Havitz’s hand, she would have died.”
For resisting the emperor’s son.
“The lady-in-waiting screamed with her eyes covered. Young Havits looked around her with her bloody hands on her. And what happened to her?”
While everyone was paying attention, Uorin twirled her fingers and said.
“Everyone in the room clapped and praised Havis. I mean, with a terrified look on his face. That is absolute power.”
Shirone murmured.
“I don’t know what is right.”
“okay. There is no opportunity to learn environmentally. But not all children of powerful people become atrocities. There may be more we don’t know about… … .”
Uorin shrugged.
“Maybe there is no reason. No matter what kind of training, Habitz might have become atrocious.”
Gudio said.
“Young kid. That’s a hint.”
Uorin clicked with her fingers.
“That is correct.”
* * *
Upon entering the grand hall of the imperial castle, Vulcan was waiting with a world map open.
As a result, with all four Gustav artists gathered, Havitz rose to the throne and stretched out.
“Asker.”
Zetaro, who had prepared a powerful drug in an instant, handed him a smoke pipe, and he bit into one and smoked it himself.
Vulcan said while Sumodo was rolling around holding on to any of the maids in the Grand Hall.
“We have captured Pasippa. The mayor was captured alive, and the number of citizens who have been recruited is approximately 70,000.”
Havitz, drunk on drugs, shuddered.
“Kill.”
Zetaro, his eyes wide open, stumbled over and pulled Havits by the hair and rolled it to the floor.
“Hehehehehe, that’s funny.”
While Havitz sprawled out and his lungs were throbbing, Zetaro sat on the throne like an emperor and shouted.
“Kill it!”
“Live burial.”
Harvitz’s pupils suddenly became clear.
“Make a huge pit and bury everything. Save only those who crawl out.”
Sumodo, who was lying on the maid, turned his head.
“Do you know how much it will cost to bury 70,000 people?”
“It’s fun.”
There was no disagreement with that, and Vulcan stood up.
“I will instruct you that way. It must be quite spectacular, but when you are ready, let’s go see it.”
said Natasha.
“song! go! I miss you!”
Havitz, who had been freed from Asker’s addiction before he knew it, looked up at the ceiling and said.
“… … I’m not going.”
The action of the sumodo stopped.
“You pour that money and you don’t even look at it?”
“That makes it even funnier.”
Zetaro tapped the armrest.
“Puhahaha! I know what! I know what!”
Vulcan and Sumodo blinked, and the eyelidless Natasha tilted her head.
“Heh heh… … .”
Those who finally realized burst into laughter.
“Oh, it’s a boat! driving me crazy! Is this really great? you’re not going? I’m not really going… … Fuhahaha!”
The frightened maids trembled.
‘Crazy guys… … .’
I don’t even want to know what’s funny, but they look really happy with tears in their eyes.
“Knock-knock! Knock-knock!”
Natasha sped through the hall and began spinning in beautiful ballet movements.
Havits chanted.
“… … This world is fun.”
playground.
Although, when my mother calls me to eat, I have no choice but to go home crying.
* * *
“I hate to admit it, but… … .”
My teeth tremble just thinking about it.
“Atrocities are as pure as the spirit of a newborn child. It’s just that the direction we pursue is different.”
There is no notion of how to behave.
“Maze’s line, Shirone’s child, Nane’s ball, Gaold’s middle. Now you know what this means.”
Shirone has traveled a lot.
“The last thing you need to know is Havitz’s evil. So we have to accept this terrible fact.”
A time of chaos.
“Evil is pure.”
The eyes of those who accepted it shone sharply.
“And only the purity of that evil… … .”
Uorin nodded.
“okay. It is the only point where we can squeeze through the cracks of evil.”
The method to kill Harvitz was decided.

[781] Justice of Evil (3)
* * *
War broke out.
The Gustaf Empire, which had rapidly advanced to the capital of Cotria, was now on the verge of being captured by the enemy.
‘Gustav Havitz.’
Sitting atop the spire of the imperial castle, Shirone looked at the night sky with sad eyes.
‘It’s atrocious.’
When I heard the news that the Gustav Empire had buried 70,000 citizens of the city of Pasippa alive, my eyes were dizzy.
Even the commanders did not come, and the captured women were said to have been sold into slavery to their own people.
‘How can you wear a human mask… … .’
When Kotria falls, the gaze of the Gustav Empire, which has finished the crackdown, will be directed to the entire world.
“I need to find a way quickly.”
As Shirone muttered, Minerva flew up the spire in a jet.
“When did you come back?”
While the card gamers were looking for a way to kill Havitz, Shirone focused on sealing the altar.
“An hour ago. Near Aganos is almost blocked. How is the design of <Law Killing>? Are you making any progress?”
Minerva shook her head.
“I got the rough strands, but there are a lot of fine-tuned things to do. First of all, the amount of change in the law is too vast, and we have to approach the alpha and beta fish we are looking for carefully.”
Shirone said sullenly.
“okay.”
“It’s getting clearer little by little. Just solve a few key issues and you can start moving right away.”
“Yes, please.”
Shirone prepared to leave Aganos.
“You haven’t forgotten, have you?”
Minerva asked.
“I’m staying in Kashan, so I’m taking care of the altar here. Keep in mind that the Crusade is a human organisation, and Uorin also uses you to advance her country’s interests.”
“I know that much.”
Wu Lin is not pure.
With the ability of Mitochondrial Eve, she looks down on the world from the top, but she is still human.
The reason why he wanted to kill Harbitz was that his atrocious temperament threatened Kashan’s future.
‘Whatever you think… … .’
After all, he was a person who lived for himself, so he couldn’t be treated as simply as Nane or Miro.
“Nothing will change. Because I also don’t want Havitz to ruin the world. The same goes for the altar.”
“I’m glad then”
Just as Minerva snorted, Gando surged from the bottom of the imperial castle, regurgitating lightning.
“The Empress is calling.”
Shirone, looking back at Minerva, raised her hand and emitted the light of Yahweh, and they disappeared in an instant.
“There was. I’m glad.”
Upon arriving at Uorin’s room, across from the people playing card games, there was an unfamiliar figure.
“That person… … ?”
“I am the envoy of the Republic of Korea. I entered Kashan through the temple’s highest security channel. I don’t know Gustav.”
Since he already knew that he was on the brink of fall, he had a rough idea of why the death god had come.
‘But it must be irreversible already?’
The Republic of Korea’s intention to ally with Gustav was thoroughly shattered by burying 70,000 people alive.
‘Is it a feeling of grabbing at least a straw?’
As the collaborators of the Republic of Korea emerged above the surface, the temple also turned its back.
“Sit down for now. I’m running out of time, so I’ll explain quickly.”
Uorin delivered the Shinigami’s words instead.
“To begin with, I will incorporate the Republic of Korea into the holy war again.”
Minerva asked.
“What do we get in return?”
Even if Uorin is the leader of the crusade, we cannot arbitrarily acknowledge a nation that tried to neigh with the enemy.
“Ancient weapons. I will provide the Ex-Machina to the temple.”
“… … Enough.”
Minerva was convinced, but Shirone, who did not know about the Ex-Machina, was still in doubt.
“Is it a weapon powerful enough to change the battlefield?”
“Maybe, maybe not.”
Ness, among those playing the card game, said as Uorin handed over the floor to the majors.
“The Ex-Machina is an anti-legal weapon. Change the law within the radius. It is not certain, but there is a theory that the Archangel of Creation, Kariel, made it.”
Kariel disappeared.
“It’s called a weapon, but it’s more like an arithmetic device. Detect and analyze all the factors that a specific factor affects, and run the simulation until the desired result is obtained. Based on the results, we can revise and reapply the law.”
Mays said.
“For example, if I want to have pasta for dinner? Someone nearby needs to make pasta. So what if he wants to think of making pasta? My wife will have to buy pasta ingredients from the market. Then, how about for my wife to buy pasta ingredients?”
Agaya said.
“By digging endlessly in this way, we can find the first factor we need to get the result we want. maybe that’s absurd It could be because a man fell in the morning four kilometers from here.”
Gudio said.
“Of course, what the Ex-Machinas provide is only a simulation. But what if we induced the man to fall in the morning from four kilometers away based on that result?”
Shirone swallowed his saliva.
“We can print the desired result as it is at specific space-time coordinates. A painting that is only one of many possibilities. Tonight, Mais, eating pasta, a picture of the whole city with a view.”
That’s why it’s called an illness.
“It exceeds the capacity of the human brain.”
Gudio nodded.
“It’s true that an angel is a genius, but it’s impossible to make something like this without Cariel’s level of creativity. In any case, with the Ex-Machina, our design becomes more perfect.”
Woorin intervened.
“The most likely theory is that the origins of the Ex-Machinas were created in battles with ancient Gaians. It must have been for the purpose of controlling their actions against Heaven… … .”
said Minerva.
“There are no Ex-Machinas found other than this. It may have been lost, but it may not have been mass-produced in the first place.”
“Production… … stopped?”
Shirone came up with a possibility.
“okay. If it’s the latter, the Gaians have solved the Veron problem. You can get away from the law and change the future with your own will. I don’t know if it was possible from the beginning or if it was reached… … .”
“It has been reached.”
If it was possible from the start, I wouldn’t have made Kariel either.
“Eleventh sense, Ultima.”
A race that broke through the laws of the Ex-Machina against Ankera’s resistance and established an integrated mental system.
‘Gaia.’
They didn’t know who they were, and they missed Shirone.
“by the way… … .”
Shirone, who had lost her mind, asked.
“No matter how great the power gap is, why are we being pushed helplessly when there is such an ancient weapon?”
the shinigami said
“Ex-Machinas are not omnipotent. There are three main reasons why we lost to Gustav.”
The Shinigami’s fingers folded one by one.
“First, lack of manpower. As you may have heard of the functions of the Ex Machina, the performance is divided into thousands of different categories depending on the user. Originally, it was something that angels calculated. Without at least equivalent brain function, the moment you enter the device, you go insane.”
I didn’t want to go in because that would be the case for sure.
“Second, the limits of the radius. The radius of the Ex-Machina is up to 200 kilometers, so wide that it is called a map weapon, but it can’t even cover a quarter of the Republic of Korea. At least I had this to protect the capital. That’s why we are negotiating alliances like this.”
The Shinigami clenched his fists.
“Third, Total Military Vulcan. I don’t know how that’s possible, but whenever the Ex-Machina changes the law, it reacts almost instantly.”
it was a crowd
“If we change, the other side changes too. Due to overloading each time, all 5 users of the Ex Machina died. Although there is a 2nd team, it should be said that they do not have the strength to fight when the 1st team is defeated.”
Revealing each country’s inner circumstances meant that it was risking life and death for this alliance.
‘The same applies to the temple. If the Balkans read the discipline, we also need the 5 most outstanding… … .’
Shirone raised his hand.
“Wait, 5 people?”
The Shinigami explained.
“Originally, it was a space for one angel, but it is a device that exceeds the amount of information that humans can process. So I connected the brains of four people in parallel, and connected the remaining one in series to make the final decision.”
As Shirone turned to the people playing the card game, Agaya shook her head.
“We’re going into the parallel side. The balance of brain functions is important, but teamwork is important.”
Although they lost to Vulcan, they were undoubtedly the strongest four in terms of team.
“Then who’s left?”
“The temple will find a good partner. The important thing is that we are the ones who are in a position to decide our opinions. If it’s just a machine-like Servant that’s good at arithmetic, there might be a few in each country… … .”
“It’s a matter of value judgment.”
Ness nodded.
“Environmental factors should be able to solve basic human emotions as an equation. We need the temperament of a gambler who can bet on a game while his brain function is not inferior to ours. Creativity is also important.”
It was a very demanding condition.
“I’ll leave it to the temple, but the first person that came to our mind was the Black Line’s Snake. Now he joined Shion under his real name Sein. It would be possible with him.”
Sein’s Cheolryun’an calculates both emotion and reason at the same time, but Uo-Lin put on a puzzled expression.
“I’ll send an official letter asking for cooperation, but it’ll probably be difficult to bring him in.”
“Why? Shion would want to stop Habitz more than anything else, right?”
“The movement of Heaven is unusual as Terraforce no longer judges the apostasy. Currently, Sein is enlisted in the Heaven defense line along the labyrinth. You will not be able to join us in this, which may take several months.”
It was a matter as important as Harvits, so even the people who played card games abandoned their lingering attachments.
“Ambiguous. Most Servants have weak emotions. What we need is not a great calculator, but a perfect gambler. But to find such a person… … .”
“there is.”
Shirone’s eyes trembled with excitement.
“Human emotions can be represented by equations… … .”
There is a bar where the movement of the hologram was designed by predicting the emotions of all students at Alpheas Magic School.
“Excellent computing power.”
When he emits electricity from his eyes, he can calculate all events in the city in 3 seconds.
“A gambler who is willing to take risks when necessary.”
He led Scrumble Royale to victory.
“that… … Is there anyone?”
While Minerva tilted her head, Uorin smiled meaningfully.
“Hmm, indeed… … That would be fun.”
Shirone, who was encouraged by those words, stood up from her seat and turned to Uorin.
“Can I recommend one person?”
She readily agreed.
“That is an honor. If it is a letter of recommendation from Yahweh, you will not be able to recklessly present an opposing opinion even in the temple.”
While Shirone smiled, the two pointed at each other and spat out at the same time.
“Mercodyne Eruki.”

[782] Justice of Evil (4)
* * *
The letter with Kashan’s seal arrived in Tormia by the fastest route on the Red Line.
It was a registered letter delivered directly to the head of the dragon, and Albino left as soon as he read the letter.
“smart.”
When there was no answer to his verbal knock, the albino opened the door and entered the room.
“If someone comes, look at me.”
Through the gap in the pile of papers piled up on the desk, Eruki, whose eyes were wide open, lifted her face.
“If you are a human, look at what condition I am in.”
Albino came.
“Looking at the crazy guy saying crazy things, it seems he hasn’t gone crazy yet.”
“… … What happen?”
Eruki openly revealed his troublesome face.
“Congratulations. Now you don’t have to bother with chores.”
When the albino threw the letter, Eruki lowered his gaze to check Kashan’s seal.
“What is this?”
“A scouting offer came from Kashan. go to the temple If you don’t mind, I will actively support you in the kingdom.”
Eruki paid attention.
“That’s Okay. I haven’t settled down here yet. What kind of temple is this? Anyway, useless… … .”
The Mercodyin family, which served as the head of the Dragon Thunder for generations, was proud of the son who did not want to cut off the line.
“You didn’t like it, dragon.”
“You don’t go to the bathroom because you don’t want to poop?”
The albino kept his cool and watched his son who was absorbed in his work.
‘Yes, even Mercodyne is just homework for you.’
This has been decided.
“Don’t do that, at least read the letter. The conditions are quite good, and you will like it.”
When the albino knocked on the table where the envelope was placed, Eruki stopped working and frowned.
“You said you weren’t interested. I’m busy right now, so go home… … .”
“It’s a letter from Shirone.”
Eruki snatched the envelope and took out the letter.
“… … .”
I read the letter as fast as my eyes moved, then went back to the first page and savored each sentence.
“Whoa!”
After entering all the contents into his head, he exhaled deeply and rubbed his face with both hands.
The albino, who knew what his son was thinking, said with a warm smile.
“go. the world wants you The situation is dizzy, but I can protect Tormia.”
There were no words spoken.
“You have a talent that others do not have. But even that talent is nothing more than a miracle of probability created by all mankind rolling the dice. Don’t think it’s yours just because it came to you. Write for the world.”
“… … I’ll go.”
Eruki’s eyes were firm as he made his decision.
“It would be fastest to use the Red Line International Station. Kashan will open a military channel when we arrive at Molton Kingdom.”
All countries under the Red Line have a magic circle facility in their association that allows them to jump to other countries.
“When is Baska held?”
“In the next 57 minutes. If you miss this, you will have to wait 12 hours. I will go through the procedures, so go to the Magic Association now.”
However, there are many things to consider when jumping between countries, such as diplomatic issues, so the opening time of the magic circle is limited in accordance with international law.
‘You won’t have to wait in Molton…’ … .’
In Molton, a border country of Kashan, it was possible to jump directly to Kashan using the Empire’s military channel.
“It will still take quite a while, won’t it?”
Taking into account the delay of each station, we had to wait on average about 6 hours per country.
“Sleep, eat and eat on the way. Don’t forget to exchange for international currency. If you have a good wife, they will take you unconditionally. Maybe not? Will your face eat you on another planet, or in another country?”
It wasn’t worth responding to.
“I’ll meet Nade and leave right away. Please take good care of me even if I am not there. In the end, he’s the one who will explode, so there won’t be any damage to the kingdom if you keep him.”
Nade, who returned to Tormia with Liz, was researching an ancient weapon with the authority of a dragon mine.
“… … Please.”
Even the albino could not joke about the back of his son leaving the world.
Eruki packed his briefcase and headed straight for Nade’s annex.
“Nade, go in.”
The kingdom’s first-class secrets and documents containing information about ancient weapons were scattered on the floor.
Nade sat smoking a cigarette at a table littered with empty bottles and half-left coffee cups.
“It is a very good thing.”
Nade’s appearance was almost a dead man.
“what’s the matter? Aren’t these business hours?”
Eruki, who had picked up a bottle of alcohol that had been run over by his foot, asked as he put it in the trash can.
“When you drink, do you come up with good inspiration?”
Nade, scribbled on paper, patted his temple, sucking on his cigarette.
“Let me relax. You can think creatively only when you release the tension that you must do.”
“Then how about coffee?”
“Awakening the tired brain.”
“Then what about cigarettes?”
“It tightens the blood vessels in the brain to speed up the blood flow. I can think more than the same amount of time.”
So called, it was the three kinds of creation.
“Then die.”
“I can still hold on. because you are young It’s all about choice and concentration. I’ll quit everything once this is resolved.”
Now Nade needed 120 percent.
“What’s going on anyway?”
Nade, who was relieved from being immersed in the ensuing conversation, raised his head and looked at Eruki.
“glad rags? Where are you going?”
Eruki took out a letter.
“Shirone calls me. I think I need some help. I’m going to Kashan. You won’t be coming back for a while.”
“Shirone?”
Nade jumped up on the table.
“I am? Did you call me too?”
Eruki pretended to read the letter.
“It says you are not needed. People like you just get water in a plate and snore… … .”
“Don’t play around.”
Nade snatched the letter and read it.
“Hmm, that’s it, right?”
Nade’s eyes, blurry from fatigue, regained their clear firearms.
“Anyway, I’m sorry.”
“joy! to be sorry Go and help Shirone. Because I have work to do on my own.”
Nade returned to the table and wrote inspiration in scribbled handwriting.
“Let’s see what I will do in this war. I’m going to make a lot of money and destroy those who made Shirone cry.”
No money, no war.
‘cheer up. I can do it.’
Nade, who was a pure engineer, believed in achieving his potential when he became an engineer aiming for money.
“I’ll contact you.”
Nade raised his hand in silence, and Eruki slowly closed the door and left the room.
* * *
“Im here.”
Shirone, who had been walking around Aganos’s spacious room, jumped at the official’s words.
‘come! I’m here!’
Upon arriving at Aganos’ castle gate, Minerva and the people playing card games, Uorin, were out.
The Empress of the Empire didn’t have to come to meet her, but Uorin was just in a good mood.
‘Because it’s Shirone’s friend.’
Getting to know a loved one’s friend is as enjoyable as getting to know a loved one.
“Open the inner door.”
As Eruki appeared through the opening of the huge door, Minerva raised an eyebrow.
“Is that kid Eruki?”
The Servant that Shirone praised until his mouth was dry.
‘Certainly not an ordinary appearance.’
He had light brown hair, one set of eyes, and was skinny, and his coat was bigger than his body, so the sleeves fluttered.
Eruki raised his hand while the people he imagined looked like Sein were watching with puzzled expressions.
“It’s been a while, Shirone.”
There was no reply, and when Minerva turned around, Shirone was crying.
“Eruki… … .”
are on the same side
He was a friend who would never change and stay by his side no matter what future unfolded.
“Eruki… … this person… … .”
Shirone broke down in tears.
‘Is it like that?’
Minerva looked back at Eruki.
‘A person who can be okay no matter how weak he is.’
The infinite mage’s spirit, which even Garcia admired, seemed unshakable under any circumstances.
Seeing that Shirone collapsed in a second, she too had no choice but to acknowledge Eruki.
“Why are you crying?”
Putting the briefcase on the floor, Eruki smiled and came closer and hugged Shirone.
“Was it hard? Good job.”
It was enough comfort, and Shirone, who was speechless, just nodded.
Uorin smiled and approached.
“nice to meet you. I am Theraze Uorin, the Empress of Kashan.”
“Thank you for inviting me. I’m Shirone’s friend Eruki.”
Even with the apex of the Three Emperors in front of him, Eruki looked straight in the eyes and asked for a handshake.
‘Mitochondrial Eve. Is it the eyes of a person who contains history? You did well against a woman like this, Shirone.’
Uorin also recognized it at a glance.
‘Extremely strong heart. Even though they’re friends, they’re really different.’
While exchanging glances, thinking that it would not be easy for each other, Shirone said brightly.
“Eruki is a researcher belonging to the Tormia kingdom dragon mine.”
Woorin smiled as if he had accepted.
“Of course you know. It must have been a difficult trip, but thank you for accommodating a difficult request.”
“You have to listen to know if it is difficult or easy. Please reserve a seat for now. Because I want to start quickly.”
It was not yet resolved, but the eyes of the people playing the card game were finally bright.
“great. Gando will guide you.”
The destination was the Panic Room.
It was small, but it was good for private conversation, and people who were new to each other briefly introduced themselves.
After the greetings, Wu-Lin conducted the meeting.
“Shirone may have written it down in the letter, but hearing it yourself will help you make a decision.”
The whole situation of the war, as well as the concept of atrocities, and explanations of Ex-Machinas and <Law Killing> were continued.
“Hmm, a weapon that changes the law.”
As expected, the part that the Servant Eruki showed the most interest in was the ancient weapon, the Ex-Machina.
Gudio said.
“It’s okay to call them out and say this, but it’s unknown how well you’ll handle the Ex-Machinas. I have to take a test. Teamwork also needs to be checked.”
It’s not that I’m ignoring Eruki, but the world’s strongest brain was needed to handle the Ex-Machina.
“If I drop out, I might just have to go back. It doesn’t matter who recommends it.”
“of course. I don’t mind anytime.”
Ness brought out the key.
“In addition, please keep quiet about the Ex-Machinas you heard today until the war is over.”
When Eruki, who failed the test, disclosed the information to his country, all strategies were in vain.
“… … I see.”
It was a problem that could have made him feel bad from Eruki’s point of view, but he nodded his head obediently.
“By the same token, we cannot provide information about the alpha and beta fish we are looking for. The summary is here. Then, go to the Ex-Machina.”
“That doesn’t matter either. but… … .”
The people playing the card game stopped leaving and turned to Eruki.
“Alphafish and betafish. I don’t know who it is, but I think I know what you’re looking for.”
Agaya asked.
“Why do you insist on being human? It would take a lot of laws to kill Havitz?”
“No matter how the law is changed, in the end it is human beings who define good and evil.”
Gudio met Ness’ eyes and asked.
“so… … Who do you think we are looking for?”
“Two emotions that will ripple through the purity of chaos.”
Eruki extended his index and middle fingers.
“The one who loves Havitz the most, and the one who hates Havitz the most. These two are absolutely necessary for <Slaughter> to succeed.”
“… … .”
Upon exposure of the core strategy, the card game players remained silent, neither affirming nor denying.
“Okay, let’s begin.”
As Eruki made his way to the exit of the panic room, Shirone and Uorin turned to each other and smiled.

Chapter - 783 - Alpha fish(1).txt
===============================
[783] Alpha fish (1)
The Ex-Machina was a cube measuring 4 meters wide, 4 meters long and 4 meters high, and weighed 7 tons.
It was made of smooth metal and had henna, the language of angels, engraved in gold on the black surface.
“It looks like a giant metagate.”
Minerva agreed with Shirone’s words.
“Even if Archangel Kariel made it, the technology is still based on the mecha system.”
Wu Lin added.
“Meccas like cubes. It may be for technical reasons, but this form itself can be seen as a mecha.”
I nodded my head naturally when I remembered the Mecca civilization I had encountered in heaven as well as the magic warehouse Istas.
“Let’s begin.”
When the god of death opened the Ex-Machina, there was room for five people.
The people playing the card game, which had already been demonstrated, entered first, followed by Eruki last.
“Eruki, do your best.”
Four people sat side by side on the second floor, and Eruki took his seat in the center of the first floor.
When I placed my palms on the hemispherical glass on both armrests, a device resembling a drone descended from the ceiling.
With the EEG sensor covering his nose, Eruki turned his right hand over and raised his thumb.
“You don’t have to work too hard from the beginning.”
After the voice of the god of death, the exit of the Ex-Machina closed, and after a while, a terrifying mechanical sound was heard.
Shirone covered her ears at the noise that filled the large warehouse and slowly stepped back.
As time passed, the sound got louder, and when the 7-ton weight was about to shake, the god of death shouted.
“Damn it! Don’t overdo it!”
The noise was so great that only my lips seemed to move, but I was able to fully realize the seriousness of the situation.
“Eruki… … .”
Twenty minutes passed by quickly, and finally, the hellish noise died down and the exit opened.
As thick steam spewed out, the iron door opened, and Eruki immediately jumped out.
“Wow! Whoa!”
Seeing him lying on the floor and vomiting gastric juices, people kicked the ground and ran.
“Eruki! are you okay?”
Looking down at the ground with shocked eyes, he hadn’t yet realized that it was real.
“What happened?”
When Shirone turned her head away with resentment, people playing card games descended with bitter expressions.
Gudio looked down at Eruki and said.
“Passed.”
It was a brain function that could be said to be monstrous.
“Our tutorial is to manipulate the winner of a 4-player card game.”
“So what?”
“In the middle, Eruki struck first. Are you bored? So we also raised the plate.”
said Ness.
“This is the test. Changing the final winner in a tournament of 300-player card games as we designate.”
Agaya added.
“It is a difficulty in which you have to manipulate not only the win and loss of each game, but also the real-time financial status of 300 people, and even the drawing lottery. It passed the test by making the 17 characters we designated, one after another, the final winner, such as the one blinded by greed, the foolish one, and the beautiful woman.”
“… … Did you do that simulation in 20 minutes?”
In real life, it was the amount of information that would take a month, and just hearing it made my head throb.
“Oh, I am going to die. My head spins around.”
Shirone, who supported Eruki as he stood up while wiping his lips, threw a tantrum.
“Be honest! Did you overdrive?”
No one can live long enough for the sparks from the cortex to escape through the pupils.
“are you okay. That’s about it.”
Transcendence is to transcend the barriers of a specific world, and this also applies to Overdrive.
However, what Eruki destroys is not the natural world, but the living world, and even his own body.
“What is this about! What should I do if I overdo it in the test, not in real life? I am… … .”
The memory of Eruki going into overdrive during the graduation exam remains painful for Shirone.
“If you ever get it wrong… … !”
Shirone’s eyes grew hot.
“Shirone, my father said so. There are many people in the world who want to do this but can’t.”
Just because it came to me doesn’t mean it’s mine.
“We, humans, can never move forward unless those who can do it do it.”
Shirone remembered the day she first met Eruki.
‘Yes, you were that kind of person.’
People playing card games in a solemn atmosphere also acknowledged him with one heart.
‘I thought it was childish behavior… … .’
A young man who was willing to carry a burden as heavy as his enormous talent, he was a good partner to fight with.
Eruki patted Shirone on the shoulder.
“Anyway, I’m used to it now. There won’t be any ugliness like this in the future, so don’t worry.”
said Ness.
“No, you did very well. When we first started the Ex-Machina, it stretched for almost an hour.”
Achaia said.
“Let’s start training in earnest tomorrow, and we’ll have a little briefing today. Come follow us.”
As long as it was accepted as a team, what the people who played card games knew, Eruki had to know too.
“See you later, Shirone.”
Eruki, who was following them, looked back at Shirone and winked one eye.
“… … .”
It meant don’t run away.
* * *
The imperial capital seen from the spire was as dark as the deep sea except for a few small lights like fireflies.
‘Amy… … .’
Shirone couldn’t sleep either because he knew why Eruki insisted on meeting him today.
“sorry. The meeting is late.”
Eruki descended from the top of the spire as if on a slide, and stopped with his foot on the railing just before he fell.
“Oops. Is this your room?”
Lying on the slope with an arm pillow in his eyes, Eruki’s eyes captured countless stars twinkling in the night sky.
“Good. Not even frustrating.”
Shirone smiled and welcomed him.
“Did the meeting go well?”
“It is a very sophisticated strategy. The problem is that it is not easy to find alpha fish.”
“Who loves Harvits the most?”
“huh. Alpha fish are also called pilot fish. It is the fish that enters first when raising ornamental fish and creates the environment of the aquarium.”
Eruki raised his index finger.
“Because it is important to put the first button well. Those who hate Habits, Betafish can be found if you want to find them… … .”
Thinking that the talk would be too long, I stopped talking about work and went to the main topic that Shirone wanted.
“The other kids are doing well too. Nade is developing technology in Yongle, and Dante got a job at the Tormia National Intelligence Service. He ate together a few times… … .”
I missed my days at Alpheas Magic School.
“Maya rejected the proposal from a famous agency in another country and signed a contract with a performance agency in the kingdom of Tormia. Fermi seems to have left the kingdom, and then… … .”
Since he was a dragon in charge of events throughout the country, Eruki was also quick to know about the current situation of his alumni.
“Everyone is living a busy life.”
However, he didn’t say anything about the person he really wanted to hear about, Amy.
“… … How are you doing?”
In the end, Shirone asked.
“ha.”
Eruki opened his heavy mouth.
“Since you said goodbye through your dreams and left, I passed the official exam. And not too long ago, while I was training as a Tormia Magic Corps Officer… … .”
“While receiving it?”
Shirone swallowed his saliva.
“It looks like you are dating another officer. If I meet you, please tell me thank you for all this time.”
“Eh, Amy?”
Shirone’s face turned pale.
“Puhahaha! It’s a joke! There’s no way Amy would be without talking to you.”
Shirone was really angry.
“you really! No matter how joking it is… … !”
“It would have been really nice if it had been like that.”
Eruki stopped talking.
“He left the training center halfway and came to me. He was holding the temple’s recruitment notice. He said he needed a letter of recommendation, so he wrote it through someone he knew.”
“If it’s a holy war, Valkyrie?”
“okay. Do you know what I mean? Tormia isn’t that serious yet. But the crusade searches for battlefields. Somehow, life is in danger.”
Amy’s voice lingered like a dream.
– Because I’m going.
“To meet me… … .”
“okay. you called me because i needed it But not Amy. I risked my life to somehow become the person you needed.”
Raising his upper body, Eruki looked down at the capital.
“I wanted to stop, but I couldn’t. I felt good when you called me by letter. So I understand Amy’s feelings. Neid too, we want to fight together.”
Shirone was speechless.
“once… … How about going to Valkyrie? You can tell the queen. Are you the leader of the temple?”
“It is rather the opposite.”
It wouldn’t be nice to show a crush on Amy when he knew Uorin’s heart.
‘No, he must already know.’
He wasn’t stupid enough to ruin things out of jealousy, but there must have been a reason for not telling Shirone.
“It hasn’t been decided yet. There is a letter of recommendation for the kingdom, but that’s what all applicants have. If Valkyrie does not pass her own training, she will return to Tormia.”
“I will pass.”
There was no way she would give up trying to meet Shirone even without mentioning the Karmis family.
“… … okay. That is why it is a problem.”
The two young men sighed.
“Eruki, you said you felt good when I called you.”
“It did.”
“It’s the same. Because the country will too. If the day comes when I can confidently meet Amy… … .”
A bright energy lingered in Shirone’s eyes.
“I really need Amy. I’m sure Amy will make it.”
if that day comes
“It is already spring.”
It was a better morning than yesterday.
* * *
Southern Kashan.
The city of Harmatan was an area where the military facilities of the Empire were concentrated, and it was also the location of the Valkyrie Army Headquarters.
“Day! row! bell! big! Day! row! bell! big!”
Amy was present at the place where Valkyrie applicants from all over the world entered the training center, raising their voices.
“hurry! Hurry up, you kids!”
It numbered about 300 people, and unlike ordinary troops, the proportion of women exceeded 30 percent.
“The man this way! The woman over there!”
After giving a letter of recommendation and receiving a name tag, the scary instructor like a tiger yelled threats and separated the men and women.
“quickly! Why are you so slow! Do you still think that you are the flowers of the kingdom? You fools!”
All applicants were talented people who were favored by the king, but there was no one who did not excel in the temple.
‘It’s no different here.’
From going through special schools in each country to passing the official exam, they were familiar with competition as if they were breathing.
‘It’s just going higher.’
Amy recited the line with a calm expression, and the other applicants did not seem to change their emotions.
I was waiting with a name tag on my chest, but the instructor pointed the baton at the iron gate.
“This is your grave!”
On the signboard hanging under the arch, ‘Welcome to all of you who applied for Valkyrie.’ it was written
‘Wrong spelling.’
It was the most terrifying thing since coming here.
“Everyone enter!”
As the military band started playing, the instructor raised both arms and shouted.
“Welcome to Hell! Corpses!”

[784] Alpha fish(2)
The place where Amy arrived was the parade ground where you can see the accommodations for female applicants to stay.
Male applicants were crowded across the barbed wire, but the distance was too great to see properly.
‘Are they training separately? If so, Valkyrie was a little disappointed.
“The commander is entering!”
A tall man with dozens of scars carved on his face like a medal came walking with an instructor.
“Salute to the commander!”
While salutes and slogans from different countries exploded simultaneously, some volunteers did not move.
Either way is right.
Even so, Gomez, the commander of the Valkyrie Recruitment Platoon, growled like a tiger.
“You’re such a ragtag! ok? What a mess!”
Among the close to 100 women standing in a row, none showed off their displeasure.
“From now on, you guys will experience horrendous sexism! Because I’m a damn serious sexist! There is only one reason! Because I am a man!”
Gomez punched the first applicant in the face.
“Are you feeling bad? ok? Answer me!”
“no!”
Again and again, a voice rang out.
“It’s a confirmed elimination! I have no pride in this! Why did you crawl all the way here to wage a war?”
Gomez, who moved away before the first applicant could even refute, asked the person next to him again.
“how about you? Are you feeling bad?”
“yes! I feel bad!”
“shut up! What if you feel bad? I’m the boss, you’re just a pawn! If it sucks, be the commander too! So do your best to discriminate against men! Got it!”
“All right!”
Gomes turned to the instructor.
“As you all know, this place is hell! And especially hell for women! I’m a male chauvinist with a bad temper, and I have severe anger control disorder!”
After opening the box containing the letters of recommendation, he took out a bunch of documents and waved them to the applicants.
“You know what this is? A letter of recommendation with the seal of the king. Of course I didn’t even read it! is this kindergarten? What are you asking me to do by throwing away just one of these things?”
The letter of recommendation was ripped from the top of Gomez’s head.
“No need for shredding paper! Do you know what a demon is? They’re just like me! If I see fuzzy kids like you, I’ll go crazy wanting to bully them! So tore the demons apart… … !”
Gomes, who was giving a long speech, stopped talking with an absurd expression while looking at someone.
“Hey, you.”
At first, no one responded.
“you! Red hair!”
Amy looked away, confirmed that they were pointing at her, and took a step forward.
“Admission Crew Karmis Amy!”
Gomez, who was silent for a long time, asked.
“… … What are you wearing makeup on?”
Amy was a little taken aback, but immediately came to her senses and raised her head.
“No makeup!”
“Oh yeah?”
Gomez came closer and inspected it.
“You’re not wearing makeup, are you? Absolutely awesome! The demons will be very excited! Why the hell did you come here? Did you come to seduce me with that face!”
“no!”
Sparks flew in Gomes’ eyes, and he punched Amy in the face with a fist.
Falling to the floor, Amy struggled to comprehend the situation, but she stood up first.
“Ask again! Are you tempting me?”
Amy came to be a general.
“no!”
Gomes, whose face was distorted, hit Amy with more force than before.
“wake up!”
Amy stood up like a tumbler
“I will ask you one last time! You better answer well if you don’t want to be the first one to drop out! Are you going to seduce me?”
An angry shout erupted
“no!”‘
The moment he clenched his jaw and closed one eye, Gomes returned to his seat and shouted.
“Now listen carefully! All I ask of you is one thing! just die! That is our job!”
Everyone was in high spirits.
“Where is the person in the world who wants to die? That’s why we need you! It is a soldier who gets paid to die on their behalf! let’s do our thing! Death is the most sublime!”
100 women also came to this place through fierce competition, but their eyes were different from when they first came.
“more! Enter the inn and get supplies! As soon as we eat lunch, we will start the word-of-mouth news!”
Gomes, who gave the instructions, headed towards the male cadets, and the instructor followed and asked.
“How is it? I was worried about the situation in other countries, but when I read the recommendation letter, there were many more talented people than I thought.”
“Tell me what are you doing? War is the enemy. Did those flower-like kids come here because they wanted to die?”
Gomez was also a pathetic father of two daughters at home.
“These are resources that will be the core resources of Valkyrie in the future. Dealing with demons is completely different from dealing with humans. Train it harshly to the point of shedding tears of blood. Otherwise… … .”
Life flashed in Gomes’ eyes.
“Because you will shed bloody tears on the battlefield.”
When the instructors left, the women finally relaxed and let out a sigh.
“I asked what it would be like as a world army, but there is nothing special.”
“Because there is a limit to holding it with military force. It doesn’t matter what kind of training you receive.”
Amy caressed her tingly, swollen cheek and listened attentively to the conversations of the other applicants.
“Looking at the last Valkyrie call-up notice, in addition to noncommissioned officers and officers, they were recruiting generals as well? It’s a great opportunity to learn from talented people.”
As expected, thinking that no one is weak, Amy made up her mind, but someone touched her shoulder.
“uh… … !”
Amy’s eyes widened at the unexpectedly welcome face.
“Tess! Did you apply too?”
Tess of the Elsaine family.
Lian’s friend and member of the trio with Amy and Arin in heaven was smiling brightly.
“Hey, Amy. Did you get attention right from the first day?”
Amy smiled bitterly.
“I know. I must have been completely captured.”
“He must be a pervert. If I had hit him one more time, I would have come forward and beaten him.”
If it was Tess’s personality, it would remain that way.
are you okay. Even though it was hit with a fist. If I had slapped him on the cheek, I would have beaten him too… … .”
will be strong
If I go higher and become a general, then I will be able to meet Shirone with confidence.
Tess, who felt the aura from Amy’s calm expression, smiled kindly.
“okay. Let’s make sure to pass and show our example.”
Amy, suddenly aware, asked.
“By the way, what about the swordsmanship school? Do you have any motivation for suddenly supporting Valkyrie?”
Tess’ face darkened.
“My father passed away. It looks like you were attacked by the demon army while protecting the colony when the altar was opened.”
Amy’s eyes darkened.
“ah… … .”
“are you okay. because it’s not sad His father was only carrying out his duties as Commander of the Occupation Territory. However, his demons cannot be forgiven. So he read the official document and applied for the post of noncommissioned officer.”
“A sergeant? Aren’t you an officer?”
With Tess’ swordsmanship skills, she could have become an officer in the Valkyrie Army.
‘So you want to fight.’
to avenge his father.
“Amy, are you an officer?”
“huh. The Valkyrie Magic Squad didn’t pick a noncommissioned officer. Even if it’s an officer, the actual deployment is the same anyway.”
Since magic mastery belongs to a special class, it is inevitable that the scale is smaller than that of infantry.
That’s why the promotion is fast, but there were many cases where even a lieutenant colonel was directly put into hand-to-hand combat.
“however… … .”
Tess asked hesitantly.
“Have you heard any news about Lian?”
“no. Totally two pieces of news. It seems that even the Ogent family doesn’t know about it. Haven’t you contacted me either?”
Tess responded with silence.
“To be careless. I will give you a message.”
My heart hurt more because Lian would be the only person who could fill the loss of my father.
“are you okay. You’re that kind of guy Now that you’ve gotten stronger, you must be eating well and packing well wherever you are.”
Amy had a boyfriend who couldn’t read women’s minds.
“joy! It’s enough without such an idiot. You have Amy now, right? If the night is lonely, I can go out with you.”
Amy’s face turned pale as Tess wrapped her arms around her body.
“Wait, what did you just say… … .”
“Uh huh, you don’t have to take it off like that. After all, this is an army. We have no choice but to be self-sufficient.”
Amy, who was moving along with Tess, who was pulling her by force, asked nervously.
“Tess, are you kidding? huh? This must be a real joke… … .”
“Ho-ho-ho! I don’t know! How will I change too!”
Tess’ laughter embroidered the parade ground among the applicants who were still face-to-face.
“Who laughs like that?”
As the window of the command and control room opened, the general who personally attended the entrance ceremony looked down at the parade ground.
“What about those children?”
The world’s strongest flame mage, Luda Garcia.
He gave up his position as the head of Nam Eamond’s Magic Association and was currently serving as the commander of the 2nd Corps of the Valkyrie Magic Unit.
“who is this? Why are you so relaxed?”
“Lieutenant Commander.”
The officer on duty checked the two women running away laughing, then went through the files.
“This is Karmis Amy and Elzaine Tess. Their homeland is Tormia, and they seem to have known each other for a long time. also… … .”
The officer on duty wiped his lips with his tongue.
“According to intelligence, the lovers of those two are the Ivory Tower Five Stars, St. Arian Shirone, and Macha Knight, Lian.”
Garcia’s eyes widened.
“Knight of Maha? They are going straight south from the northwest region of Kashan, wiping out demons?”
Lian’s location is top secret.
“yes. Valkyrie offered me a general position, but I know you rejected it.”
“Which of the two is Oh Dae-sung’s lover?”
Shirone was in debt.
“Hey, red hair.”
Garcia caught Amy’s face in his eyes.
“Could you sort out all the items related to training results, achievements, and major specialties and send them to me?”
The officer on duty took a stand at attention and answered.
“yes!”
It was the lieutenant’s order.
* * *
What the Republic of Korea obtained in exchange for the Ex-Machina was the full support of the holy war.
The Crusade struck the western part of the Gustaf Empire with 30% of the Valkyries fighting the demons.
In the face of objective figures, the military discipline of the Balkans had no choice but to hesitate for a moment, and thanks to this, the Republic of Korea was able to breathe.
“It won’t last long.”
Next to Shirone flying to Aganos, Minerva flew in on a jet.
“Even though the Jincheon Empire in the east, the Holy Temple in the west, and the Republic of Kotria in the south strike at the same time, all we can do is block their expansion. The military power of the Balkans is certainly phenomenal.”
“Because he is the one who fights against the world. In the end, getting rid of Harvits is the quickest solution.”
And now, the information that the first button was sewn was delivered to Shirone and Minerva.
“… … What kind of person is he?”
The Ex-Machina team found the Alpha Fish.
“Anyone would be insane.”
Atrocities, chaos, ignorance.
He was a person who truly loved Havitz, a collection of all kinds of unpleasant concepts.
‘Is it possible?’
Even Gustav’s 4th class was only attracted by the smell of his own people, and it was far from love.
“You came quickly. What happened to the altar?”
When I arrived at the imperial castle after crossing the wall with the free pass, Eruki was waiting at the entrance.
“I came while it was being sealed. I heard that it is an urgent matter. Has the alpha fish arrived?”
“huh. I’m waiting in your room now.”
“What kind of person are you?”
“that is… … .”
Eruki twitched his lips, but eventually gave up on explaining and turned himself into the imperial castle.
“let’s go. See and judge for yourself.”

[785] Alpha fish (3)
* * *
Woorin’s room.
While the Ex-Machina team sat in a row of chairs, a woman was standing there staring at them.
As Shirone and the others entered, Uorin, who had been watching from the corner, approached with her index finger to her mouth.
“You’re here. We just started.”
Shirone looked back at the woman.
‘That person is an alpha fish.’
I expected a hysterical impression, but I was nervous with my eyes down.
“It’s surprisingly ordinary.”
“no.”
Minerva looked at the woman with serious eyes.
“That woman… … They are of the same kind as me.”
A woman born with the fate of a witch.
There is no evidence that any impression becomes a witch, but there is a common disposition among those born with the fate of a witch.
‘Aura that encourages desire.’
I want to bully you, I want to break you, and I feel like I’ll be relieved only when I see her crying while holding onto the blanket.
Uorin, who once lived with the impression of a witch, also felt the same as Minerva.
“That’s right, it’s a witch statue. But surprisingly, she’s not a witch. She runs a small flower shop now.”
Minerva narrowed her eyes.
“Witch… … no?”
If it had been so easy to defy fate, Minerva would not have made <Law Killing>.
Shirone asked.
“What happened?”
“first of all… … Let’s watch.”
When Eruki joined the Ex-Machina team, Uorin turned to him and nodded.
Received the signal, Gudio said.
“Mr. Youth Abella.”
Minerva’s eyebrows twitched.
‘Survivors of Youth?’
At one time, it was a huge village that competed for the 1st or 2nd place in the gypsy clan, but it is now known to have lost its pulse.
“Yes, please.”
Abella’s voice crept in.
“Don’t be nervous. It is not a place for interrogation. I called because I had a few things to check. First of all, you must know why I came to the imperial castle, right?”
“Yes, I heard. The mustache, no, Mr. Harvits… … .”
Abella was the first to raise her head.
“He is a very bad person.”
It was an expression that he knew in his head that Havitz was a wicked man, but couldn’t accept it in his heart.
Eruki said.
“that’s right. I have killed many people, I am killing many people, and I will be killing many people in the future. You probably know the case of burying 70,000 people alive. I need your help.”
“I-how can I… … .”
Mays asked.
“Do you think Harvits shouldn’t die?”
Abella hurriedly shook her head.
“no! If you do something bad, you must be punished! I don’t think it’s okay to kill people!”
Eruki let out a long breath.
‘It’s a witch’s fate, I know what it is.’
Even now, without realizing it, the Ex-Machina team is harassing her.
“You can tell me honestly. Even if Mr. Abella loves Havitz, we won’t harm him in any way.”
Gypsy has no hometown, but Kashan was an enemy country to her, who spent her childhood in the Gustav Empire.
‘Besides, since it’s in front of the empress, it’s natural to be nervous.’
Abella took a moment to catch her breath and calm herself down before looking at Eruki with a clear gaze.
“no. I think Harvits deserves to die.”
Still, it was strange that it didn’t sting my heart.
“From now on, I will explain.”
Wu Lin walked forward.
“They first met 14 years ago, when Havitz was 27 and Abella-san was 9.”
Everyone noticed her.
“Traditional kin killing unique to the Gustav family. Harvits was notorious for brutally killing countless of his siblings. At the time, it was said that the emperor’s sending Havitz XVII to Arcava, the easternmost point of the empire, was not a strategic choice. perhaps… … Even Havitz, 16, must have been afraid of his son.”
It was a story that Abella did not know.
“In the end, Havits XVII killed 781 brothers and became emperor. During the three resets, the method of killing them was always different. You killed your brother in 2,343 ways.”
so it’s confusing
“And at the time, that is to say, the way Havitz did it 14 years ago by the standards of the Great Purification… … .”
Uorin coldly lowered her gaze.
“He would tie his brother and wife to the ceiling, and have dinner by boiling their children.”
As if struck by lightning, Abella’s body trembled.
“14 years ago from now.”
Arkaba, the easternmost point of the Empire.
“Aww! You child! stop! Are you even human! You will be punished!”
Havitz’s half-brother screamed and coughed up blood as he hung from the ceiling.
The wife caught next to her had already lost her mind and was urinating while making a grotesque laugh.
“Hmm, what part is this?”
Harvits, who sliced the meat with a knife, took a fork and looked around.
“Aww! stop!”
Twenty-seven-year-old Havitz didn’t look much different from his face after becoming emperor, except that he had a handsome mustache.
“Fondue.”
After dipping the meat into the soup, he tasted it in his mouth and mumbled it, and his brother burst into tears.
“please… … Please. you become emperor I will help you. I’ll somehow make you emperor. So stop… … .”
“Emperor?”
Havitz put down the tableware and wiped his lips.
“Your brother is very strange. What’s funny about the emperor? That kind of thing is boring.”
“Then why… … ? Why even your nephew… … .”
Harvits looked up at the ceiling.
“The process of becoming emperor is fun.”
“Huh!”
Havitz’s older brother realized.
Dozens of brothers are still sharpening their swords, but the emperor of the empire has already made a decision.
“Kill it. Okay, stop now.”
“I’ll eat my brother for dinner too. Dessert for my sister-in-law.”
Seeing the fishy smile with his nostrils wide open, Havitz’s older brother felt like the world was spinning.
“You son of a bitch! You will get the same! My brothers will definitely punish you! Curse me! Even if I die, I will pray for you to suffer in Hell!”
Harvits yawned.
“Bored.”
When he flicked his finger, the string that bound him broke and he fell 20 meters down.
With a thud, another corpse appeared, and blood slowly spread outside the sprawled brother’s body.
Habitz asked the lady-in-waiting.
“Isn’t there anything interesting?”
There were no loyal subordinates to speak directly to him, not even swindlers who flattered him.
The lady-in-waiting, who was just terrified, said with trembling hands.
“Brother, your family members are still there. Since you are in a dungeon, why not torture yourself… … .”
“Torture is no fun, after seven.”
The maid’s shoulders trembled.
“sorry! Presumptuously giving advice without understanding Your Highness’ deep intentions! Please forgive me!”
Harvits stared at her.
“Is something sad going on?”
The maid with her face raised hurriedly shook her head.
“yes? Oh no. I am not sad.”
“Then why are you crying? Are you afraid of me?”
One thing the people around Havitz terribly disliked was being questioned.
‘Well, what should I answer… … .’
Even if it was scary, I thought I would die, and even if I wasn’t scared, I thought I would die.
In the end, emotions won out.
“It’s scary! ah! That’s not it, sorry! please forgive me! Foolish me… … !”
Havitz came to the point where the mind was gradually going crazy and the language was going crazy.
“Are you afraid of me? why?”
Havitz’s face, no, his two eyes, as he watched from close by, was so clear and beautiful.
“I’m afraid I’m going to die.”
Unknowingly, the words came out.
“Hmm. Are you that afraid of dying?”
Havitz, lost in thought while fiddling with his mustache, nodded.
“Then I won’t kill you.”
“really?”
I asked again this time.
“huh. Are you done now? I’m not going to kill you, so no one’s going to kill you?”
I had never tasted such a powerful sense of salvation in my life.
“thank you! thank you!”
While the lady-in-waiting kept bowing her head, Havits put on her coat and said.
“I can’t be bored. gotta go out and play Oh, and my brother’s gasoline, all have their knee joints pulled out.”
The maid’s face turned pale.
“Me, me?”
“If it bothers you, tell the minister. Take all of your brother’s property and gasoline. Maybe 200 people? You can play with it until you get tired of it.”
As the maid looked dazed, Haviz turned outside the door and winked.
“Live with a smile. Enjoy.”
The smell of blood wafted through the closed room.
Habitz, who had traveled two hours by carriage from Arkaba, arrived at the East Sea.
The place is famous for fishing, but after hearing rumors that Habitz was coming, all the nobles had fled.
“It’s quiet. Are you lucky today?”
Among the nobles as well as the commoners, there was no one in Arkaba who did not know the name of Habitz.
Havitz, who settled in a remote place where the forest was spreading, threw a fishing line without even hooking a bait.
“Ahhhhh.”
The boredom of the world was evident in his expression as he yawned.
Havitz’s playground is always empty.
“It’s boring no matter what you do these days.”
Left alone in a playground where no one visits, what are you waiting for?
“Isn’t there anything interesting?”
It was before I met the 4th Gustav.
“Boo. Maa. Boo.”
I make sounds by changing the shape of my mouth, and then I look at the world with cross-eyed eyes… … .
“Aaaaaaaaaa!”
He turned his head and screamed as if to suddenly destroy the peaceful silence.
“Boo. Maa. Boo.”
Then I heard a girl’s voice behind me.
“huh?”
Harvits turned around and the dirty girl in the gypsy outfit moved her lips exaggeratedly.
“Boo. Maa. Boo. What are you talking about?”
Havitz blinked and pointed to the sea.
“The sound of fish.”
“ha ha ha! How do fish make sounds? And they don’t catch fish here! Are you an idiot?”
“huh? mister?”
Harvitz pointed at himself with his index finger.
“Am I not your uncle?”
“Are you okay, uncle? You’ve grown her mustache. haha! Mustache Ahjji, Mustache Ahjji!”
Harvits licked his lips and grabbed the fishing rod.
“I wish I could catch a shark.”
The cow, who had been laughing briskly at this sight, approached Havitz and pulled his mustache with an eighth.
“ouch!”
“uh? Is that a real mustache?”
With tears in his eyes, Havitz tidied his mustache.
“This is mine. And since you are a woman, you won’t grow hair like this even when you become an adult.”
A shadow fell over the girl’s face.
“I know, me too. what a woman is.”
“okay? What is a woman?”
She smiled again and sat down at the fishing spot.
“Mister, I’m bored. Do you want to play with me?”
After thinking for a moment, Harvits nodded.
“okay. But what are you playing with?”
“I play with dolls. You are a monster, and I am a beautiful woman who runs away from monsters.”
The girl took out a doll made of woven cloth.
“sleep. This is a monster.”
What was called a monster was just a man whose physical characteristics were exaggerated.
“Okay, I’m a monster.”
Havits, who took the doll obediently, slammed it on the floor, imitating the monster’s voice.
“Kuaaa! Where do you run away! I’ll chew it up with my sharp teeth and eat it!”
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Help me! It’s a monster!”
Habitz moved the doll and followed.
“at there! This beautiful… … !”
Then, suddenly, he stopped and asked.
“Wait a minute. what is your name?”
The girl also took a break from playing for a while, looked up at Havitz, and then said, baring white teeth.
“Youth. Youth Abella.”

* * *
Mitochondrial Eve is powerful in that it can transmit 100 percent of an individual’s experience to the next generation.
Even before they got the name Theraze, they divided like cells and absorbed the history of the whole world.
And by integrating it back and passing it on to the next generation, a vast database was built.
History search.
Uorin, who can search most of the history, found the first meeting between Havitz and Abella.
“Meeting Harvits changed Abella-san’s fate.”
A small smile appeared on Abella’s lips as she recalled the time while listening to Uorin’s explanation.
“It was so much fun playing with Mr. Harvits. Unlike other adults, I knew what I liked.”
Even though he is pointed out as the most evil person in the world, he couldn’t deny Abella’s words.
“I know, it is the fate of witches. She has been told by those around her since birth.”
The Youth were a tribe of gypsies who understood the Torah.
“If Uncle Harvits hadn’t shattered my cursed fate, I would be a witch by now and live in pain.”
The story goes back to 14 years ago.
“Let’s drill this way and make an underground waterway. Big enough for a monster frog to pass through.”
In the sand at the fishing spot, Harvits and Abella were busy making sandcastles.
It’s been more than 10 days since the fishing rod without bait has been stretched out towards the sea, but the shark Havitz wanted has not been caught.
“Are you familiar with sex?”
“Of course you know. Because it is my home.”
Abella, who was pounding the ground and flattening it, lifted her sandy face.
“Uncle, are you the emperor?”
“huh? Emperor?”
“You said your name was Harvits. Adults say that the emperor of this country is Habits.”
“Ah, that’s Havitz, 16 years old. That person is not me.”
“Can I use the same name as the emperor?”
“Hmm, well? maybe you can write There are hundreds of people with the name Habitz that I know.”
Abella muttered sullenly.
“It would have been nice if you were the emperor.”
Havits, who completed the underground waterway with delicate hand movements, belatedly asked.
“Why Emperor? I don’t think that would be very interesting.”
“Because I can do anything. Her mother says, she said, I have to become an emperor to change my destiny.”
“fate? What is it?”
After 10 days of hanging out together, Abella brought out the darkness in her heart.
“The tribesmen will see me and become a witch. My mother is also a witch. That’s why I dedicate myself to men every day.”
The Youth tribe was in decline.
“In the past, the Law of Youth was very strong, so many people asked for divination. That’s why I was able to overcome the witch’s fate. But now they said that period was over.”
The tribesmen could not cut off the name of Youth, which had a history of thousands of years, from their generation.
“Now we can’t do divination. That’s why women with a witch’s fate go around town and sell themselves.”
In Bardol Village, where the Youth tribe is currently staying, fishermen as well as pirates lived.
In reality, the two were not different.
“I don’t want to go back to the village. Adults keep coming and touching me. Her mother once got angry, and she beat to death adults who were much taller than you.”
“I guess being a witch isn’t fun.”
“of course. What would you like? Just thinking about witches is terrifying. I want to grow flowers.”
“Then can’t you? witch.”
Abella shook her head.
“They say you can’t change the law. My mother holds me and cries every night. I’m sorry. But, she said, she had no choice but to become a witch after all.”
“I do not know what I mean.”
“Of course, Uncle doesn’t know. Only gypsies know.”
“I don’t want to be a witch, so why do witches? It’s just that you don’t have to.”
perfect chaos.
The law was an absurd concept to Havitz, who was out of the rules of how it should be.
“You can do whatever you want. It’s good to live happily, don’t you have to do boring things?”
“… … Could it be?”
Abella, who was lost in thought, smiled brightly.
“But these days, it’s fun to play with you. I used to always be alone in the woods.”
A nice sandcastle is complete-
“I’m having fun too. There is no one to play with in the castle. If I did anything, I would whine and cry.”
Abella grinned as Harvitz copied the frightened faces of those around her.
“Ha, I wish I could play with you every day.”
“Then you can play every day.”
Abella noticed.
“But you are an adult. Mom said, adults are busy, so don’t bother them.”
“are you okay. Because playing with you is the most fun. You don’t have to do anything else, what does it matter?”
Abella’s eyes blinked prettily.
“I think you are very different from the adults I know.”
“What is different?”
“Do this, don’t do that, they don’t talk about this, they don’t bother me.”
“What about the other adults?”
“It’s not like that. How nagging is that? You have to be a good person, you have to handle tableware like this… … .”
Havitz twisted his mustache.
“Hmm, I’ve never heard anything like that in my life, so I don’t know… … .”
So, I realized the fact.
“The people who say that are because they are afraid. Grown-ups, I see, are always terrified.”
“What are you afraid of?”
Harvits shrugged.
“Puhaha! I don’t know. What on earth are you trembling about in this world? I try to go straight, as if there is only one line on an invisible cliff.”
Havitz pretended to walk on two fingers.
“When I walked around, there was no single line. no matter where you go is it natural But are you pretending not to know?”
“Ugh. They say it won’t fall.”
“Of course, if you want to play, you have to give people what they want. But if you don’t want to play with me, you don’t have to listen. The downside is that it’s a bit boring, but… … .”
Harvits comforted Abella.
“As long as you are not afraid, you can do anything. you grow flowers Don’t listen to boring stories like witches.”
I didn’t understand all of Harvitz’s words, but it was the best comfort Abella had ever heard.
“huh! I will grow flowers from today! Thanks, mister!”
Habitz grinned, baring his teeth.
From that day on, whenever Havitz and Abella met, they went into the forest to pick flowers.
one song per day.
I didn’t know the name or variety of the flower, but I was just happy to be able to do what I wanted to do.
The shark still showed no signs of being caught.
“Should I go out and catch it?”
Havitz, who was sitting at the fishing spot, yawned profusely as he gazed at the open sea.
“Why are you so late today?”
Abella, who had never been late until now, was not showing up today.
“You don’t want to play with me?”
Havitz missed Abella, so he spurned his seat and headed to her village.
It could be seen that a commotion had broken out from the entrance of the village, which had a fishy smell unique to the fishing village.
“Damn the gypsies! I picked up things that had nowhere to go and fed them, so they hit the back of the head like this!”
When the village leader Hexter kicked the skinny woman with his foot, Abella came running.
“Aww! mom!”
“Abella! Why did you come! Run away quickly!”
Abella shook her head.
“no! I won’t go without leaving my mother!”
Two months after the gypsies settled in the village, the pirates, who were fed up with it, tried to get their hands on Abella.
The mother, who was desperately resisting, went on to carve fingernail marks on Hexter’s cheek.
“Does this town or anything that has no foothold dare touch me? I want to die here!”
The chief of Youth stood in the way of the mother and daughter.
“I said I would do it if you gave me a job! Didn’t you all follow what you suggested!”
“job? Do you think the likes of you can go out to sea? Do you think the house, food, and chicken we gave you for free!”
“I am leaving! Send them away!”
Haxter let out a big laugh.
“Okay, leave. Instead, should I throw up everything I’ve eaten so far and go?
That’s moral, isn’t it?”
Haxter, who had pushed the chief, grabbed Abella by the hair and pulled her from her mother’s arms.
“mom! mom!”
Abella’s clay vase broke, and an unknown flower was ruthlessly trampled on.
“No! Abella please… … !”
“shut up! At this level, it’s barely worth the money! Take me!”
The chieftain crawled to the floor and shouted as Haxter’s men carried Abella on their shoulders and headed for the barn.
“You bastards! What is the child guilty of!”
“crime? Of course there is. Sin without money.”
As the men giggled and fought back, a voice was heard outside the crowd.
“Abella~. No-ol~ now.”
In an instant, silence fell, and everyone turned around to look at Havitz.
“What are you?”
The pirates, who reflexively drew their swords, saw Habitz and turned pale like ghosts.
“The King of Desires… … ?”
Shaking, the pirates’ weapons fell to the ground.
“Heh, hehe!”
It was the first time to actually see it, but there was no one among the residents who didn’t know Havitz.
‘Damn it! Oh God! why! Why the hell!’
Are you saying Harvitz is here?
‘it’s over.’
No one knows why they came to such a rural village, but one thing was clear.
‘We all die.’
There is no mercy for the king of desire.
“Aww! mister!”
After escaping from the weak pirates, Abella burst into tears and ran to Habitz.
“Yes. It’s okay, it’s okay.”
Havitz, who lifted Abella with all his might, patted the girl on the back as he walked towards the pirates.
“I’m afraid, mister! Those people trampled the flowers! I beat my mother to death too!”
“Yes. It’s okay, it’s okay.”
Realizing that he was acquainted with Abella, Haxter’s fingertips trembled.
‘What have I done?’
You can stab a sleeping demon in the side with a sword and you won’t hear anything dumber than this.
“Your Highness, we… … !”
“die.”
Harvits stopped talking.
“I don’t want to play because Abella is crying. die.”
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
Haxter yelled as if to destroy his mind, then drew his sword and cut his throat horizontally.
“Gagging!”
Seeing his death in a single blow, the other subordinates drew their swords and followed the same path as the captain.
‘This is the only salvation!’
Because if Harvits decides to play properly, it won’t end with death.
While most of the pirates chose to commit suicide, the residents did not have the courage to bear it.
“Captain of the Guard.”
As soon as Havitz’s words fell, the shadow glided closer and revealed its true identity on the floor.
“Please tell me.”
He was wearing a white mask with a mustache and a black cloak covering his entire body, and crossed his curved twin swords.
“Capture the villagers alive. All sentenced to cancer.”
“All right.”
Eyes gouged out, noses cut out, eardrums ripped out, tongues pulled out, arms and legs amputated and skinned.
It was a cancer type that he had to suffer for the rest of his life while receiving fluid in that state.
“Aww! That’s not allowed!”
As the villagers ran out to get the pirates’ swords, the shadow of the captain of the Guard moved faster than the wind.
“Kill me! please! Just kill me!”
Those who fainted came one after another.

[787] Alpha fish (5)
“Huh… … .”
All the villagers fainted when the man, who was about to die even by biting his tongue, was hit on the back of the neck and fell down.
The only ones awake were the gypsies, but they were dressed differently, so it was easy to tell them apart.
However, even if it was impossible to distinguish, it would have been no problem for the captain of the guards to search out the guilty residents.
‘This is why Your Highness is unique.’
Harvits is not afraid.
‘Even if you are criticized by the world, Your Highness is also the ultimate of a certain level that humans can pursue.’
This was the reason why he, who had the title of Imperial First Sword, was willing to serve the king of the outskirts, who was almost in exile.
‘I will definitely make Your Highness the emperor.’
Seven years later, he is decapitated by Natasha, a battle doll who came to Havitz’s playground.
It is said that the last will he spat out from his severed throat was ‘I saw the ultimate battle.’
“Habits?”
The gypsies stared blankly at Havitz holding Abella.
Even though he was not Emperor Gustav Havitz 16, the mere fact that he was Havitz ruling the eastern outskirts of Arkaba was like heaven to them.
‘I heard he’s an unprecedented tyrant.’
They were gypsies wandering the world aimlessly, but they knew that among the sons of the emperor, there was one with a madness that knew no bounds.
“Abella! Come on! hurry!”
Having tasted the brutality of Habitz through the pirates, even Abella’s mother couldn’t bear to approach her and only beckoned.
“Don’t be afraid.”
Harvitz whispered, and Abella nodded.
“huh. I am not afraid at all now.”
Even the scene where a person died is a catastrophe no different from a natural disaster to a nine-year-old child who almost got raped.
But what mattered to her was the fact that there were no more villains harassing her.
“Because you defeated the monster.”
Only adults see the invisible line.
“Put me down.”
Although the world’s leading scholars have not been able to give a clear definition of the character Havitz.
“Are you going to your mother? Shall we play tomorrow then?”
In Abella’s eyes, Havits was just a boy his age with superpowers stronger than any other adult.
“We must leave now.”
Having lived the life of a gypsy, Abella knew that tomorrow the tribe would move the village.
“okay?”
Harvits showed a sad look.
“Abella, come here. Don’t bother the higher ones.”
Just as her mother mustered up the courage to approach, Abella reached out to Havitz.
“Mister, since I’m an adult, can you give me some money?”
“Abella!”
Mom shouted.
“Yes, I will give you 10 billion gold. I have a lot of money.”
Harvitz obediently agreed, but Abella shook her head as if that wasn’t the case.
“no. I’m going to buy a flower here. This time, by knowing the name and breed. And I’m going to do a flower business.”
“How do you do business with one flower?”
“Flowers are sown every year. If there are enough flowers to grow, nurture, and open a flower shop… … .”
Abella burst into tears.
“Would you like to visit my store? Let’s play together again.”
Perhaps he was so sad about parting with Abella, Harvits sniffed and rummaged through his pockets.
“of course. If you want to play together, you have to listen to what you want, so I will definitely go see the flower garden.”
A gold coin was placed on the little hand.
“Abella!”
As Harvits left town, Abella’s mother ran over and slapped her on the butt.
“What the hell have you been doing? You almost died! know?”
“Aww! Why do you hit me!”
At the words of the child, who did not seem to know the seriousness of the situation, the mother grabbed her by the shoulder and met her eyes.
“Look Mom! Didn’t she tell me not to hang out with anyone? you… … Do you know who that person is?”
“huh? that person?”
Looking back at where Harvitz had left, Abella opened her tear-stained face and said,
“Mustache Archie.”
“Uhhhh! Heh heh heh!”
On the way back to the castle, Habitz cried out sadly, and the captain of the guards said,
“Your Highness, if you feel so sad about parting, can’t you bring all the gypsies to the royal castle?”
As Habitz’s crying suddenly stopped, a murderous feeling that the captain of the guards had never experienced in his life stabbed into his eyes.
“I’m sorry!”
He didn’t know what was wrong.
“Abella said she would take care of the flower garden and show it to me. But do you want me to bring you? Are you still human?”
‘I can’t figure it out at all.’
Is it so important that Abella tends the flower garden and that Harvitz later visits it?
‘Even though it seems like you’re doing what you want… … .’
sometimes completely insulated
‘No, that’s also the foot of desire.’
The idea of a promise made with a nine-year-old is only for adults.
For Harvitz, it was the most powerful driving force in life.
“A witch.”
The reason why I didn’t cut the head of the head of the guards was because I felt that there was some reason.
“Before the people of Bardol were put to death… … .”
The guards commander immediately bowed his head.
“Please tell me.”
“Investigate all family ties. Investigate the residents’ cousins, eighth cousins, and even the first cousins, and kill them all. Don’t miss out on one person.”
“yes?”
As a rough estimate, the number must have exceeded 10,000, so the guards commander raised his head.
After reading the sincerity from Havitz’s face, he hurriedly lowered his back and spewed out an answer.
“I will follow your orders!”
* * *
“It wasn’t something I knew.”
Wu Lin said.
“Havitz is free from the law, but he must feel another precept that refers to himself by the number 2 of the law. Of course, due to the nature of chaos, it is far from reason. Anyway, sensuously… … .”
It was a shocking result to the point of being stunned.
“He actually killed about 22,000 of all the inhabitants of Bardol, after examining first and second cousins.”
Watching Abella’s shoulders tremble again, Minerva opened her mouth.
“You knew it, sensuously.”
“okay. Maybe 14 years ago, if the chaos called Habits hadn’t intervened in that village, Mr. Abella would have been raped by pirates.”
That’s how you become a witch.
“Even if he hadn’t awakened from there, the result of the massacre of the villagers would have been a new cause in some way and would have followed Abella-san all his life.”
Havitz blocked it from the source.
“A whopping 14 years. By bombarding all her variables that were likely to haunt her until she reached adulthood, she made her legal mess. That is why Miss Abella did not become her witch.”
Minerva glared at Abella.
“Did you know? Since you left, all the villagers and people with even a drop of blood have died.”
“Oh no!”
After hesitating for a moment, Abella confessed.
“in fact… … yes. I heard from her mother later. If it wasn’t for Mr. Harvits, I’d be a witch.”
“They are innocent. Do you know that too?”
Abella burst into tears.
“yes.”
By the time she was nine, she could see the same things as Havitz and empathize with them.
But eventually, when you become an adult, you can see invisible lines, and Abella understood all of that.
Shirone asked.
“Did you think of calling Harvits a florist?”
“no. It’s a promise I made when I was young. Later I realized how absurd that was. The flowers I bought with the money the uncle gave me also withered in a year. At that time, I cried a lot for days.”
“the problem is… … .”
said Eruki.
“It means that promise is still valid for Harvitz. I’m still waiting for Abella to call me.”
There was no disagreement.
“Then the odds of success would be higher, but… … .”
Shirone interrupted Minerva.
“Mr. Abella, what about your current mother?”
“He passed away two years ago. Because her original body is weak. But they were happy that I opened a flower shop.”
It had been quite a while since Youth disappeared, so Abella had no family left.
Minerva opened her mouth again.
“We intend to kill Havitz. The most important thing is your will. Can you?”
‘Mister Harvits… … .’
Havitz knows how many people have been sacrificed for breaking the witch’s fate.
‘Your uncle is a bad man. He’s a really bad guy.’
Abella closed her eyes.
‘By burying people alive, starting a war, and even killing all unrelated people… … so… … .’
That’s why I live so happily
‘The conflict must be serious.’
Shirone understood Uorin’s words.
‘Evil looks attractive in some cases.’
Because they do things humans can’t.
“But you’re mistaken, Mr. Abella. Harvits are just endless chaos, man-defined atrocities.”
That’s why it shouldn’t be in the human world.
“I’ll do it.”
Having made up her mind, Abella slowly opened her eyes.
‘Yes, let’s die. Let’s die together, mister.’
Wu Lin said.
“I will give you one last chance to think. Not for you, but for us. I know it’s not going to work by forcing it.”
“No, I have decided. Although I received help from Uncle Havitz, many people died because of me.”
They also had a heart to atone for.
“I will. I don’t know what abilities I have, but I will do my best.”
When Gando took Abella out, Wu-rin turned to the audience and said.
“Once we got the alpha fish. Now, just bring the beta fish and all the preparations are over.”
Eruki leaned on his chin and said.
“… … There were survivors.”
Shirone realized it too.
“Oh, I see.”
“The 22,000 innocent people Havitz ordered to kill. But even the Emperor can’t find all of his blood relatives. Have you already found the one who hates Havits the most?”
Wu Lin spoke frankly.
“okay. Fleeing from the massacre 14 years ago, she is currently residing in Arachne Kingdom.”
Legally, it could be said to be a fantastic combination.
“Arachne? Are you in the southern hemisphere?”
Gudio added.
“The Seven Planets represent the 10 kingdoms of the Southern Continental Sea. It’s also a popular resort as a political refuge.”
“It’s also where the world beauty pageant is held.”
Everyone paid attention to Mice.
“just… … I’m curious who will win. It’s this time of year. There are no other feelings.”
Uorin sighed and said.
“The problem is that she is hiding her identity. So Shirone, I want to ask you.”
I was already promising.
“Bring me the beta fish. If it’s the Five Stars, you can request the Arachne government’s asylum record.”
“What about her?”
“My name is Amery Jaysteen. She couldn’t confirm what name she was currently using. She is twenty-seven years old, and has a burn scar from her exile under her right breast, on her side.”
An unusual wound would certainly help.
“In Kashan, it is almost end to end. Considering the waiting time at the international station, it’s no different than flying.”
Eruki asked.
“Isn’t that more monstrous?”
Woorin smiled.
“Go on Ratusa. It will help.”
A tier 3 monster, Kaidra, the monstrous bird.
When I stopped by Vanguard, an oasis in the southern desert, I had vivid memories of going through Noscarta, the god of the desert, together.
‘It was really hard, but now that’s also a memory.’
I suddenly missed Lian and Kido.
“I’ll leave right away. Please wait for Ratusa.”
When Shirone opened the door with Eruki, Mais jumped up and shouted.
“Make sure to know the color of the winner’s swimsuit!”
There was a thud and the door closed.

[788] Windless Zone (1)
When we arrived at Aganos’s airfield, Kaidra keepers had already put Ratusa on standby.
Eruki, who had followed Shirone to see him off, handed over his friend’s bag and said,
“How long do you think it will take?”
“Time will change depending on how much the Arachne government cooperates. It won’t be long though.”
If it was an ivory tower, there would be no choice but to cooperate, and it was also the reason why Uorin singled out Shirone.
“The problem is the idea of Beta Fish, real name Amery Jaysteen. perhaps… … Maybe you don’t hate Havits.”
Eruki also liked that part.
“I am the only survivor in the midst of the deaths of my entire bloodline. There’s plenty of room for fear to work out louder than hatred.”
The fact that he was hiding in a foreign country while giving up his name also strengthened his feelings.
“I will try my best to convince her, but I can’t help it if she doesn’t like it. Just like Mr. Abella, <Math> is not a weapon that can be coerced.”
“okay. We will come up with a countermeasure.”
If Shirone’s sincerity didn’t work anyway, it would be impossible to bring her back no matter who persuaded her.
“It’s not a dangerous mission, so take it easy. Arachne is a world-class resort. It’s been tough lately.”
Lately, Shirone’s face has become noticeably thinner.
‘A battle is a battle… … .”
Conflicting with demons who hate Yahweh terribly would have been very mentally exhausting.
“I will be back.”
Although she didn’t have the idea of taking a vacation, Shirone boarded the Caydra without bothering to show it.
“It’s been a while, Ratusa.”
As comrades who crossed Northcarta together, Ratusa happily rubbed her beak.
“If Kydra is tired, get enough rest. There is no need to put pressure on us.”
Shirone pulled the reins and said.
“are you okay. If I’m tired, I’ll pick it up and fly.”
As Ratusa stood up, a huge shadow fell, and Eruki’s gaze rose to a height of 4 meters.
“let’s go!”
Kydra’s heavy body, which flew out of the airfield, plummeted vertically.
Kyaaaaaaaaa!
Immediately, a clear groan erupted, and Ratusa reappeared and disappeared into the clouds.
“… … You say you burn yourself?”
Eruki shook his head, imagining Shirone with a rogue bird on his back.

Arachne Kingdom.
5-star Lubystro Hotel.
“Maya, are the preparations going well? Have you seen the sheet music for this song? Isn’t it awesome?”
Maya arrived in the kingdom of Arachne three days ago.
“Yeah, it was really good. It’s fun, it’s light.”
‘Elbor’, a performance agency in the kingdom of Tormia, paid special attention to the debut of a large rookie named Maya.
So, what was caught was the opening stage of the world beauty pageant, the biggest festival in Arachne.
“Well then. It is the result of collaboration between the best composer and the best lyricist.”
On average, more than 20,000 tourists from all over the world flock to see the world beauty pageant every year.
A handsome old bachelor in his mid-thirties, Falmus, the representative of Elbor, shook his fists.
“The timing is just right. Because of the goddamn demons, the scale has been reduced a little this year, but the coverage of each country’s media will be spread all over the world. Don’t worry, just sing well.”
“CEO.”
Maya said with a tearful smile.
“I know you are really good to me. I am so grateful.”
“Ha ha ha, what have I done? I just caught Maya’s natural singing ability faster than anyone else… … .”
“It’s really good, the song is good, everything is good… … .”
Knowing Falmouth’s goodwill, he struggled, but no matter how much he thought about it, he wasn’t confident.
“The lyrics are strange. I don’t think I can call it like this.”
“huh? lyrics?”
Maya shouted, spreading her arms.
“It’s too decadent!”
“Hmm.”
Palmus blinked as he recalled the lyrics, then nodded obediently.
“It’s not a little irritating. But is that good? As long as you don’t do it openly, you will be eaten unconditionally.”
“Still, the meaning is very heartfelt. I’m sorry to say this to a rookie subject, but this is… … .”
Palmers licked his lips.
‘This is the problem.’
With an impeccable appearance, singing is of course outside the standard, dancing is also equipped with a magician’s license, and even a sense.
‘But why the hell!’
Why are you so shy?
“Maya, can’t we just close our eyes and call? I know your personality. That’s why I also deleted the undressing sequence.”
Speaking of undressing, the shoulder line and breastbone were visible, but Mai hated it.
“Cha, I’d rather undress. It’s entirely my problem, but it’s because I’m really not confident.”
Even Falmus couldn’t be stubborn in the face of the determination to show his flesh rather than spit out corrupt words.
‘Is it that difficult?’
Being selfish with a singer is a shortcut to ruin, but honestly, I didn’t want to see Maya naked.
“okay. Then let’s do this. I’m running out of time, so I’ll bring in a lyricist now. Let’s think of an amendment together.”
“I’m sorry, CEO.”
Palmers laughed bitterly.
“This is my job. If there is anything that will take you in the future, please let me know. You have to be comfortable for the results to be good.”
Twenty minutes later, Falmus brought a man with a curly face and square glasses.
“It’s not that I don’t like it, it’s that it doesn’t seem to match the color I’m pursuing.”
Unlike the audition, the lyricist Moster sat at the table with a firm attitude of assertiveness.
“Okay, what part do you not like?”
Words came out right away.
“First of all, choose your vocabulary. will lick listening to the crackling What do you keep licking? and ambiguous meanings. A man hard as a stick. Come into my open heart… … .”
Moster hurriedly held out his hand.
“Oh, not the last one.”
Maya pursed her lips and asked.
“… … Anyway, yes.”
Moster sighed as Falmus leaned against the wall and watched.
“All writers, that is to say, those who create stories with letters… … .”
Maya blinked at the sudden remark.
“Most of them are idiots. In fact, there are only two types of writers in this world. A normal person pretending to be a writer, an idiot pretending to be a normal person.”
Moster tapped his temple with his index and middle fingers.
“Two thoughts run through an artist’s head at the same time. A very logical and filthy boring idea, a thrilling and terrible idea that destroys that logic.”
He snapped his index and middle fingers like scissors.
“Those two thoughts interact like electricity and become a logical and fun storytelling. double personality. It’s going crazy like that.”
“So?”
“Even while thinking of such a beautiful thing, the desire to cruelly trample it coexists. The important thing is to strike a balance. If you lean to one side, you will be ruined.”
“… … So?”
Morse pushed the chair away and knelt down, bowing his head to Maya.
“I have given up on that desire!”
“What are you doing?”
Maya stood up in surprise, but he lowered his center of gravity and did not straighten his knees.
“I was thrilled at the audition. What a great material! What would happen if I said this with that celestial voice? The destructive urge was so strong I couldn’t help but use it!”
“Are you a pervert? why do you think that… … !”
“trust me! It will definitely work! Please sing my lyrics with your beautiful voice!”
When Maya turned her head, Falmus was already opening the door and calling the guards.
“Take me out.”
Even while being dragged away, Moster did not give up.
“Please, Maya! I see you singing those words in my dreams!”
The door is closed.
“ha.”
As the exhausted Maya slumped back in her chair, Falmus approached with a smack.
“Sorry. It is entirely our mistake. I’ll try to procure a new lyricist somehow.”
I should have known the burning of personal aspirations.
“But it also means that it is a material that even veteran monsters give up money and choose their desire.’
If you can use even your bashful appearance as a weapon, it would be nice to follow Maya’s wishes.
“Okay, let’s go pure.”
Maya asked anxiously.
“There are only three days left, can you complete the lyrics in time?”
“We will have to mobilize all of the company’s manpower. Few people pull it out as sensibly as Moster, but… … :’
There was no regret about it.
“Then may I try it?”
“huh? Maya, are you?”
“yes. Actually, I don’t know what the two thoughts Mr. Moster said are, but I still want to try them.”
“Hmm. That’s not bad.”
While the lyricist was overturned, one of the strategies was to lean on the original Maya appearance.
“Okay, let’s get to work. I’ll put it up for final review. Instead, you have to practice steadily, right?”
Maya smiled with satisfaction.
‘Shirone.’
There were lyrics that I really wanted to write.
* * *
Hey hey hey!
Kaidra’s grotesque groan woke Shirone from his slumber in the morning.
“Ahhh!”
The air, which had been cold before falling asleep, had changed to the warm heat of the equator before I knew it.
“wow!”
As if the sun had broken, tens of thousands of lights were floating on the surface of the water in the windless zone.
Islands with forests and rocks were scattering colorful birds into the sky like firecrackers.
“What a wonderful place.”
Shirone shook her head.
“Still, the mission comes first.”
Shirone, who had passed the ten kingdoms of the archipelago step by step from the east, said goodbye to Rathusa in the sky above the kingdom of Arachne.
“Thank you. When I get to Kashan, I’ll buy you something delicious.”
hey hey
Shirone stroked Kaidra’s head and threw herself to the ground before it was too late.
As we descended aiming at Arachne’s capital ‘Bengal’, we heard the sound of music and crowds filling the streets.
“It is a festival.”
Unlike Minerva, the rudeness of penetrating the castle walls did not suit her inclination, so Shirone landed on a building.
People’s eyes were caught on the festival, so no one noticed the stranger who fell from the sky.
“This is the Kingdom of Arachne.”
It was the third island in the 10 kingdoms that stretched eastward from the coastline of the southern continent.
‘Aboriginal people who came over by boat from the south a long time ago are the origins of Arachne.’
Perhaps that is why, even though it developed under the influence of the continent that led the advancement of civilization, the customs of the south remained.
“Shall we go down?”
When Shirone jumped down the alley and came out to the main road, open wagons were paraded.
The moderator said as Arachne dancers in bikinis shook their waists.
“everyone! This is Miss Yakma!”
As the representative of the Republic of Yakma, who participated in the world beauty pageant, passed by, everyone’s attention was focused.
“Miss Yakma! Show me your face!”
The main character was hidden by a curtain, and a silhouette waved at someone’s request.
“You waved at me! i love you! Whoever you are, I love you unconditionally!”
People burst into laughter.
“Miss Tormia!”
Shirone’s gaze returned by itself.
‘This is our kingdom!’
As expected, only the silhouette was visible, but it was a woman with a graceful profile with her hands on her knees.
‘Who is it? I’m very curious.’
Everyone’s curiosity would be answered on the day of the world beauty pageant.
“Miss Nam Eymond!”
The host’s voice embroidered the southern sky.

[789] Windless Zone (2)
Every time Arachne’s dancers danced, the feathers swayed dazzlingly.
In the enchanted sight, someone suddenly approached Shirone.
“Definitely… … Isn’t it beautiful?”
It was a man in his thirties with spiky hair and a sparsely short beard.
“Ah yes.”
“Since I was old enough to pay for the trip, I have been watching this tournament without missing a beat. Are your eyes happy? the brain is happy Except for one downside.”
“A downside?”
The man said sadly,
“I couldn’t get married.”
Shirone was about to leave, but the man grabbed his arm and pulled him, whispering.
“It’s not just beautiful. The women who participate in this competition are the best brides with intelligence, virtue, and body. So how am I going to get married? People around you tell you to wake up, but isn’t a dream meant to be dreamed?”
The self-proclaimed world beauty pageant maniac seemed to have suffered a lot in his life.
“Do you know what my dream is? Surprisingly very realistic. You’re dating one of those women. I’ve already heard of savings.”
I thought I got it wrong.
“Every night it comes out in my dreams. I’d rather die that day if I could go on a date with the best beauties. this is a dream! It’s the biggest dream a man can have!”
“Hey, I’m a bit busy with something… … .”
“You must come to the competition, too. take this.”
When the man opened the zipper of his cross-body bag and rummaged through something, Shirone waved his hand.
“No, you don’t have to.”
It seemed like they were going to give you a ticket, but it was a Shirone that you could come in and out at any time if you wanted to.
“Okay, take it.”
What the man took out was not a ticket, but a tournament flyer that can be picked up anywhere on the street.
“… … Ah yes. thank you.”
The man who turned like a machine made a horn and shouted to the procession.
“i love you! Miss Marchen!”
Shirone, who had slipped away, slipped out into a secluded place and stuck out her tongue.
‘There are various people in the world.’
On the way to the royal castle, I saw a leaflet with portraits of previous winners.
‘Wow, it’s really pretty.’
Human charm is white and white, but their appearance definitely had a unique corner.
“uh?”
Alas, what caught Shirone’s attention at a glance was not the portrait, but the list of invited singers from each country.
“Is it Maya?”
Even when I squinted my eyes and looked at it, the name of the singer from Tormia was Maya.
‘Come to think of it… … .”
When Eruki’s words that he had signed with a famous agency came to mind, he became interested in the contest.
‘I’ll have to check this.’
If it was really the girl Shirone knew, he thought of going there at least once.
‘I wish it was Maya.’
With such expectations, I started walking again, but there was a commotion at the far end of the procession.
“Abolish beauty pageants!”
People in black masks and black clothes were holding up signs and holding a street demonstration.
“Don’t commercialize human beauty! The Arachne government must immediately repatriate the participants!”
Just hearing the slogan seemed to know what was going on.
‘It’s not a fuss here either.’
Tormia also had a beauty contest, and whenever it happened, the voices of criticism were constantly heard.
‘I understand how you feel, but… … .”
What Shirone realized while living was that there are so many people living in the world, and finding a system that can satisfy them all is so difficult.
“Oh, my head hurts.”
human.
Isn’t this a homework that neither Buddha nor Yahweh could solve?
* * *
The officials who worked overtime in the Arachne Castle were hoarse from screaming from dawn.
“hurry! There is still dust!”
The reason for the record-breaking cleaning of the royal castle is that I received a tip that the Five Great Castles of the Ivory Tower are coming.
‘It really tastes like dying! Even when kings from other countries came, they didn’t stir-fry them like this.’
At the lower end, even aristocrats carried dusters without exception, and the ladies-in-waiting were covered in sweat.
“Keep it!”
There were only a few people who avoided labor, but the mental stress was rather more.
“Why did the stars come?”
King Paronica of Arachne, who was waiting in the Grand Hall after refining her clothes, slammed the armrest.
Wearing gold earrings hanging down to his shoulders, he gave off a strong impression of both continental and southern lineage.
“Your Highness, fix it. Oh Dae-sung is not a person to be easily accepted. Wouldn’t that have a symbolic meaning?”
Although belonging to the Seven Planets, Arachne is not particularly powerful compared to other countries.
The 10 kingdoms of the archipelago were tied together under the name of ‘Cartesia’, and their representative was only Arachne.
“That’s it, but… … .”
Therefore, the fact that the Five Great Stars came to Arachne would be a good prestige for the other 10 kingdoms in the archipelago.
“I’m a stallion.”
Everyone knows that the Valkyries of the Crusade are fiercely blocking the expansion of the Gustav Empire.
‘Maybe it’s about the war.’
If the temple had been directly involved, it could have demanded a fair reward for it.
‘That’s why I sent the stars on purpose. If this is the case, isn’t there no advantage that the country can take?’
Wu Lin is a housekeeper.
“furthermore… … .”
The consul called again.
“Currently, the biggest event in the kingdom is in danger of being disrupted. I don’t know anything else, but if it’s Ohdaesung, wouldn’t we gain something?”
“Are you talking about terror threats? Hmm.”
“From what I hear, the star named Shirone is different from the other stars, so it is said that she is not that strict. There are also rumors that Eymond South delivered a huge sum of money and obtained the governorship of Eymond North. This would mean that there is no lack of desire for water.”
“But things are different with Nam Eymond. I can’t afford to pay that much for something like this.”
“Of course it is. So why not melt their hearts by offering something other than money?”
“Other… … Right. Is it possible?”
The archon smiled.
“Leave it to me.”
After passing through the Grand Hall, the consul headed to the office of the top manager hosting the world beauty contest.
“Welcome, Archon. The construction must be busy, so please find a place like this… … .”
“I came to ask you something.”
I was anxious once.
“I’m begging you… … ?”
“Miss Arachne, Barho Rangi. We’ll have to use him for something important.”
Anxiety became reality.
“… … Are you the star of the ivory tower?”
“I like it because you understand it so quickly.”
The manager shook his head.
“That’s not it. It is disrespectful for Miss Arachne to entertain a foreign dignitary.”
“Who made that Miss Arachne? Your Highness’ name. Get it ready right away and send it.”
“Wouldn’t it be another woman? Miss Arachne has never entertained. She is a child who came all the way up here while looking at only that and seeing all the dirty things.”
“Hey, Administrator.”
The administrator’s shoulders flinched at the consul’s gaze.
“Am I asking you to die? Do you want me to pick the stars in the sky? There is nothing that people can’t do! Will you come to your senses only if you have a knife in your throat!”
The manager bit his lip and lowered his head.
“I will try my best to convince you. But if the child refuses to talk… … .”
The magistrate turned coldly and opened the door.
“You better listen when you talk.”
Arriving at the royal castle, Shirone entered the Grand Hall, being greeted by high officials.
“Welcome, Star of Great Intelligence.”
When Faronica stood up, it was clearly revealed that she was one head taller than Shirone.
“nice to meet you. My name is Shirone.”
It can be said that it is definitely different from other stars in that it is short from the introduction of the name.
“haha! Also, your spirits are on the rise. Come on, come this way. I have prepared an early dinner.”
While all sorts of food were laid out on the 10-meter-long table, only two people enjoyed the dinner.
There would be no end to pinching even the smallest things, so Shirone sat down without saying a word.
“As you may have seen on the way, the parade is in full swing. If you had given me a message in advance, I would have gone out to meet you.”
“no. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen something interesting, so I feel good. It seems like a great festival.”
There was nothing I hated more than fighting demons.
“Fortunately, the. The war with the demons is disturbing in each country, but we should live happily in times like this.”
The World Beauty Contest was a cultural business that brought enormous profits to the kingdom of Arachne.
“The reason I came… … .”
Shirone, who was reluctant and got to the point, delivered most of the information except for confidential ones.
“I would like the government of Arachne to cooperate with us in reviewing the refugee records.”
“Of course I have to help. Just with names and features, it will take some time. We have to review all records of asylum seekers from the last 10 years or less.”
“I don’t have much time. How long will it take?”
“As you know, Arachne supports free exile. Still, I will mobilize all of my manpower and take care of it by tomorrow morning.”
It was an understandable time, but it was questionable that they were so obediently conveying their country’s secrets.
‘Things work out so easily.’
In any case, Arachne promised full support, so it was best to wait.
“You are free to use all facilities in Bengal. I have reserved a hotel suite, so you can stay there.”
“yes. Thank you for caring me.”
While Shirone was riding in a house coach to the hotel, the world beauty pageant manager arrived at Miss Arachne’s quarters.
“Rangi, go in.”
When I opened the door, a beautiful woman who could be trusted as a brown angel was raising her eyelashes.
Miss Arachne, Barho Rangi.
Born into a family of middle-ranking military officers, he was a genius who jumped into this world while studying history.
“What’s going on, are you coming all of a sudden?”
Seeing Rangi, who was absorbed in makeup with a nonchalant face, the manager gave up on turning his words around.
“I need to entertain.”
The hand holding the mascara stopped abruptly, but that was all the expression as if the sky was collapsing.
“Why? Where did the president of another country come from?”
The manager gritted it.
“A president can’t do this.”
Rangi continued her makeup again.
“You can say no if you don’t like it. no, of course i don’t like it. But I can only move when I hear it myself.”
“How are you going to handle the aftermath?”
“You are Miss Arachne. If you don’t like it, no one can do anything about it. If it is disclosed, the kingdom’s main business will be disgraced.”
The manager, who understood the situation where it was difficult to even answer, sighed and turned around.
“Then I know you refuse… … .”
“I will.”
Rangi finished her makeup and stood up.
“Are you serious?”
“Once again, the sincerity… … . I know better how scary people in politics are. It’s better to just close your eyes and let it go.”
Rangi walked in front of the manager and crossed his hand.
“Where can I go? Give me your profile.”
It was embarrassing to have already prepared, so the manager squeezed his voice and handed over the documents.
“Since there is a competition, I ask that you do not get hurt.”
The consideration was only that much, and Rangi turned over the file with a cold corner of his mouth.
“huh?”
Expecting a high-ranking position in the empire, she blinked at the profile.
“Wizard?”

[790] Windless Zone (3)
* * *
“who are you?”
When Shirone opened the hotel door at the sound of a knock, a woman she had never seen before stood there with a smile on her face.
“who… … please?”
It was a look that I had no choice but to ask again.
“hello! Wizard! I am Barho Rangi, who was chosen as Miss Arachne this time.”
“Miss Arachne?”
Her bright greeting eased her guard a little, but her identity brought new tension.
“What did that person do to me?”
Rangi held out the spirit magazine of Tormia Kingdom from somewhere.
“I am a fan. You graduated from Alpheas Magic School at the top of your class, and are active in the Ivory Tower, where only the world’s most outstanding wizards can enter.”
Shirone put on a blank expression.
“Hehe, I’m very interested in magic. If you don’t mind, may I ask for your autograph?”
In the spirit magazine that Rangi opened, the face of Shirone, who had defeated Dante in the 2,000 battles, was printed.
‘Was I that old-fashioned?’
He was a boy from a mountain village, but to be honest, I still can’t feel how urban he has become.
“all right. Come in at once.”
She looked around the suite while Shirone called Rangi into the room and searched for a pen.
‘It’s my first time here too.’
The Royal Arachne Hotel is where VIPs stay, and there are more than 40 rooms downstairs where VVIPs stay.
However, the room currently occupied by Shirone occupied an entire top floor.
This room is only used for people in extreme poverty, and as far as she knows, the door here opens only twice a year.
‘I’m an ivory tower wizard… … .’
A transnational figure feared by politicians, whom she describes as poisonous snakes, trembling at drinking parties.
‘It looks innocent.’
The finest liquor in the suite was untouched, and there was only one old book lying on the wide bed.
‘He has a humble personality. But what’s so scary about it?’
I even thought it was cute when I saw her running around the large room because she couldn’t find her pen.
“Oh right!”
Shirone stopped in the middle of the floor, stared at the ceiling, and trembled.
“If you don’t have a pen, take mine… … .”
Before Rangi could finish his words, Shirone shook her head and said.
“Ah, I’m such a fool!”
“huh? fool?”
Shirone sighed, approached empty-handed, and held out her hand in front of the table.
‘Material.’
As the information was assembled at a frightening speed, I had a pen in my hand before I knew it.
“Hoo?”
Rangi’s eyes sparkled.
‘Is there such a magic?’
I had seen high-ranking members of the Magic Association bluffing and using magic, but it was the first time I had ever made a pen.
“It’s fun. It’s like magic.”
Rangi doesn’t know.
It was only a pen that was made, but the theory contained in this magic is all the batteries that exist in the world.
“Hehe, that’s right. I have a habit of always looking for things, so I forget like this.”
“oh? Then can you make another one?”
Shirone laughed awkwardly.
“In theory, yes.”
Yahweh hates the act of disrupting the system, but he can print diamonds indefinitely if he wants.
However, Rangi, who was unfamiliar with magic, accepted Shirone’s humility straight away.
‘Well, if you can make anything, it’s a god?’
Shirone, who had never signed an autograph for anyone in her life, had dry saliva and her hands were shaking.
‘I can’t be disappointed. If I make a mistake, I have to turn it back.’
Perhaps thanks to being equipped with a weapon of conversion, the sense of shock, the autograph was a plausible success.
“Here’s your signature. I hope you like it.”
“I like it.”
Rangi hugged the magazine.
‘Would you like to sign an autograph for me now, Grand Wizard staying in the hotel suite?’
Even if Shirone was a good person, he did not know why he invited Miss Arachne to his hotel room.
‘You’re not bad.’
It is first-class that it does not even give the feeling of being entertained, and Rangi voluntarily opened his heart.
‘Since he’s a man, it’s only natural that he wants me.’
so.
‘I’ll forget it. All.’
May no memory of this day remain.
Just in time for her to find a way to stay here, a growl came from her stomach.
Rangi said with a shy smile.
“After starving for several days to prepare for the competition, it is now difficult to move. Even if we have dinner together… … .”
“wait a minute. I still have the bread I bought on the way.”
Feeling sorry for her because she was starving, Shirone hurriedly rummaged through her bag, but after a while, an embarrassing situation arose.
“what? this… … .”
It was a hard bread favored by travelers, and the marks of half-chewed it were clear.
“sorry. I will ask for another food.”
“are you okay. They’re all the same person. And I really like this bread. It’s great for dieting.”
Shirone never dreamed that she would give Miss Arachne leftover bread.
Rangi took the bread away, cut it in half, and handed over the rest.
“I’ll eat half. There will be jam made from strawberries. Oh, and because it’s prickly…
Skillfully finding the items and putting them on the table, she pulled out the finest wine from the shelf.
“A little bit of alcohol.”
Dinner began, and by the time the bread had been eaten, I was getting drunk.
“Shirone-san, do you have a boyfriend?”
“Yes i have.”
Rangi opened his eyes wide with a surprised expression because he asked with certainty that he didn’t.
“I met my friend at school, but now we are apart. I am a soldier by profession.”
“Hoo? A soldier.”
Calculating the compatibility with Shirone, Rangi decided that it would be better to push forward aggressively.
“In addition to her magic skills, her will is really strong. When you punch a friend named Nade in the graduation exam… … .”
Judging from how excitedly he was talking for the first time, it seemed that he really liked Amy.
‘No matter how much it is, I only talk about my lover day and night with a woman in front of me. Are you naive or stupid?’
After listening to Shirone’s story, Rangi swallowed the last glass of wine and stood up.
“right. May I give you a shoulder massage?”
When Rangi went back and touched her shoulder, Shirone’s neck shrank like a turtle.
“Ugh, I’m fine.”
Stay calm. I’m good at massage. Or what? You can’t even touch the body unless it’s your lover?”
“no! It’s not like that… … .”
Rangi’s eyes lit up.
‘As expected, this is it. I got it.’
He was a person who did not like to hurt others.
“To rub the shoulders of the most famous wizard in the world. I feel really lucky.”
“When it comes to being famous, Mr. Rangi is the best. Besides being Miss Arachne, she also participates in world competitions.”
“Huh, that’s right. Then will you promise? Let’s keep today just the two of us for the rest of our lives.”
“yes? Ah yes.”
It was a specification that Rangi got into gossip.
‘So, let’s get started, shall we? I’m going to bully you like this forever.’
Gently rubbing his shoulder, she placed her face against Shirone’s ear.
“I am so happy.”
When Shirone turns his head, he will kiss her, and from then on no man can escape.
‘Congratulations, Your Highness.’
The king will get what he wants.
“Shirone… … .”
However, as if she couldn’t even muster up the courage to turn her head, Shirone was staring straight ahead like a wooden stone.
“Shirone, look at me for a second.”
“Mr. Rangi.”
It was a resolute voice that broke the atmosphere.
“sorry. I don’t know why Mr. Rangi is doing this, but no, it must be my mistake… … .”
Only then did Shirone get up from her seat and look back at Rangi, looking at him with a drunken look.
“When I first saw it, I thought it was very pretty. But I have someone I love. As long as I don’t break up with that person, I won’t betray you.”
“It is not a betrayal. I don’t mean dating.”
Rangi used the last words, but Shirone shook her head.
“Then it is even more unacceptable. I think you’ve been drinking a lot. Sleep here tonight.”
Seeing him leave, Rangi was terrified.
“no! Don’t do that. I can’t sleep here instead of the wizard.”
“You promised.”
Shirone smiled and opened the door.
“I decided to keep it just the two of us for the rest of our lives.”
“ah… … .”
Rangi, who had been lost until he heard the sound of the door closing, slumped into the chair.
“Really? Is this really the end?”
It wasn’t a bad result, and even the promise of a promise between the two of them saved her, but why was she annoyed?
“idiot! Who knows if you’re pretending to be nice? You will regret it for the rest of your life!”
Thinking that winning is winning, Rangi jumped onto the bed in the suite and sprawled out.
“Oh, good! Yes, now I am higher than the king!”
Sensing the touch of silk as her limbs fluttered like butterflies, she turned her head to see the book Shirone was reading.
“I left it. What book is it?”
When I opened the middle of the page, it was a novel.
Rangi tilted his head and checked the title of the cover.
Dragon Beater Archmage
“haha… … .”
Dropping her arms in a collapsed motion, she ended up laughing heartily at the ceiling.
“Puhahahaha!”
Maybe Arcane is right.
“Dragon beat… … ! Hee hee!”
A wizard is an eternal boy.
* * *
the next morning.
While contemplating on the roof of the hotel, Shirone saw the sun rise and soared into the sky.
Because of Rangi’s visit, Shirone’s expression upon arriving at the castle was harder than before.
“Welcome, great star.”
King Faronica of Arachne greeted Shirone by bending her upper body.
“What happened to your request yesterday? Did you find someone named Jaysteen?”
“That is, there are too many data than I thought. It may take a little longer.”
It was as expected.
“okay.”
Faronica floated her luck thinking that it was as easy as other stars.
“Actually, something bad has happened to the kingdom lately, and the speed isn’t working due to a lack of manpower.”
Shirone was just listening.
“It is a terror threat. He said he would turn the venue into a bloodbath if the world beauty pageant was not stopped.”
Asking the star of the ivory tower means that even Arachne’s police force couldn’t catch the criminal.
“So it’s a shameless request, but if Oh Dae-seong steps forward and solves it… … . Whoops!”
Faronica, who felt the breathlessness in Shirone’s eyes, shut her mouth.
‘Hey, what kind of energy is this… … .’
Even though it wasn’t the first time seeing the star of the ivory tower, it was the pain of frozen blood tearing through the blood vessels.
“The person I am looking for… … .”
If it wasn’t for the promise with Rangi, he would have pushed Faronica even harder.
“He is the one who holds the fate of the world. Thousands of people are dying right now.”
‘Really die!’
Faronica accepted with her body the fact that the young man in front of her was the Five Great Stars of the Ivory Tower.
“sorry! I’m going to colonize the profile of Amery Jaysteen right now.”
If I hadn’t already found it, there would have been no negotiations.
‘Whoa, this job is really hard too.’
Only then did Shirone take the life out of her eyes and turned to think about the terror threat.
‘I’ll have to find out separately.’
Preventing a large-scale disaster is important, but I didn’t want Maya’s precious debut stage to be endangered.
‘I’m worried about Mr. Rangi too.’
Anyway, the priority was to find the beta fish.

[791] Beta Fish (1)
Arachne NIS submitted the documents.
It seems that he is currently leading a mercenary guild in Timaros, a small commercial city near the capital Bengal.
‘It’s the Jaysteen Mercenary Corps… … .”
Instead of changing their name, they abandoned their surname, and there were only about 10 members of the crew.
If it were normal, it would be a normal life, but there must have been too many things she abandoned to gain peace.
“Where is Timaros?”
said Faronica, swallowing.
“There is a small town 14 kilometers east of Bangor. I will order permission to enter.”
“Thank you for your cooperation. In the case of terrorism, let’s turn off the fire first and discuss it.”
It wasn’t until Shirone left the Grand Hall with the papers that Faronica could breathe.
“Whoa, what a terrifying man.”
The archon lowered his head with a contemplative face.
“I’m sorry, Your Highness. Even though I handed over Miss Arachne, I thought I would confiscate my face like this… … .”
“No, this is it. Since the word terrorism is on his lips, he won’t let go and watch it.”
Even so, Shirone’s energy was strong enough to lightly trample on the spirit of the Seven Planets.
‘Are they the eyes of the one who carries the world?’
They were the ones who called for delight when they first said Shirone was coming from among the stars of the ivory tower.
“still… … .”
Now my thinking has completely changed.
“If we compromised to this extent against Oh Dae-seong, wouldn’t we have done well?”
The archon nodded wordlessly.
* * *
Shirone flew vertically from the castle and flew straight toward the small city at the bottom of the horizon.
Upon arriving at the entrance arch, the captain of the guard who had already received the message saluted in a loud voice.
“welcome. You are instructed to make sure there are no disruptions to your work. Anything you need?”
“I’ll just look around.”
I wanted to do things quietly.
“It is the glory of Timaros. If I need anything, please visit the nearest guard anytime.”
As I passed the arch, nodding my head, I saw numerous shops lined up along the dirt road.
‘Is it because it’s during the World Beauty Pageant?’
There were more customers from other countries than from the home country, and perhaps that’s why the market had a festive atmosphere.
As we made our way through the crowds filling the streets to find the guild area, it became noticeably quieter.
After passing through smithies, alchemy, medicines, and recovery guilds, he finally found the place he was looking for.
Jaysteen Mercenary Guild
It was a building that didn’t seem like much work at first glance, as guards were enough to protect a small city.
“excuse me.”
The empty tables were sparsely placed and the counter was empty.
At a table in the corner, a group of people played a game of cards with a bottle of wine beside them.
“What are you?”
The man who had said something embarrassing to say in the first meeting was one-sided, and his tongue was twisted because he was drunk.
‘How many people are looking for… … .”
After thinking for a moment, Shirone asked.
“I am looking for some people. can you help me?”
A fat woman sitting on the right side of the table jumped up and approached.
“Oh, I was a guest. Come this way.”
Dust rose up as she tucked in the counter and put up the guestbook.
“Finding people is our specialty. Who are you looking for?”
“Amely J. Steen.”
The blood drained from the woman’s face, and the hand movements of the mercenaries who were playing the card game stopped.
the woman asked again.
“Excuse me, who are you?”
“Amorie Jaysteen. It seems that the captain of the mercenary unit here uses the name Jaysteen.”
Aekku said.
“Close the door.”
The door closed with a thud, and a black-haired man guarded the entrance holding a knife.
‘It’s quite a skill.’
Of course, it wasn’t a sign he didn’t notice, but it was a high level compared to the Silverling Guild he was in.
“You’d better say it right, kid.”
He aimed at the gun equipped with magic bullets.
“From whom did you hear, last name Amery?”
Through his questioning, it was possible to know that J-Steen had confided in his subordinates about his past.
‘In other words, a mercenary group bound by a considerable relationship of trust. I’ll have to be careful what I say.’
Shirone raised both hands.
“I am not here to fight. I came because I wanted to ask you something. You can even call it a request.”
“I should have warned you.”
One’s gun clicked, and two other men pulled out their sharp long swords.
“Speak properly.”
At the same time, magic bullets were fired, and the black-haired man guarding the entrance attacked with a dagger in his hand.
“this… … !”
When he avoided the magic bullet by teleportation, the wall exploded with an explosive sound.
“be careful! A wizard!”
“Wizard?”
The men with long swords ran up to the wall and flung themselves from left and right of Shirone.
“Yeah, but you’re a kid!”
The longsword drew an X with a vicious sound, but Shirone was already gone.
“There is no need to fight… … !”
Shirone’s voice was drowned out by the explosion of magic bullets, and the walls in all directions exploded.
‘You’re going!’
It seemed like he didn’t even care.
‘Or you judged it to be that dangerous… … .’
I couldn’t even see his face yet, but I could guess what kind of life J-Steen had been living.
“Kill! I’ll take care of the aftermath!”
The woman shouted, and the black-haired man held the dagger in reverse and pressed Shirone.
‘As expected, this person is the strongest.’
Realizing that the situation was out of the question, Shirone pulled out the Shining Chain and tied him up.
“Keugh! what is this… … ! Aaaaaa!”
At the same time, the black-haired body was turned upside down, and the longer chain stirred the inside of the guild and bound people.
“Let go! Let go of this, you son of a bitch!”
He tied the ankles of the men with the long swords and pinned them to the floor, and finally wrapped Akkoo’s hands behind his back.
“Whoa.”
Just as Shirone was breathing, the woman hiding under the counter pulled out a flute and fired a poison dart.
“Poo-wook!”
Deadly poisoned saliva rushed in, but it seemed to stop in the eyes of Shirone who cast the slow magic.
“… … .”
As I caught the needle with my index finger and thumb right in front of my eyes, the eyes of the men tied to the Shining Chain widened.
“I took it with my hand.”
In their experience, it was impossible to hold the flying spit with their hands in the slow magic, especially in the time-sharing state.
‘I hear you’ve dedicated your life to slowing down 1 percent… … .’
At the level of Alfeas, who was a genius in the photon system, the speed of time would be dreamily slowed down.
“you… … Who the hell are you?”
As the questioner’s eyes briefly turned to the side, the woman at the counter reloaded the poison dart.
“Kyaaak!”
The shining chain first wrapped around her body and pulled her upside down to the ceiling.
“Okay, okay! I am Amery Jaysteen! So release me now! Let’s talk to me!”
If true, it needed verification.
“Can you show me your wounds?”
The mercenaries’ faces became serious.
‘This guy knows everything.’
Just then, the back door opened violently and a woman with wet hair entered as if she had just finished her back.
“You children! Did you blow up the house documents? why so fuss… … !”
He had a strong impression suffering from sepa and had a gun modified for sniper hanging on his shoulder.
The shooting range was visible through the door.
“What is this funny situation?”
While looking left and right at the unsightly scene, she fixed her gaze on Shirone.
“Is it you, betting my men?”
One kid shouted.
“Leader! run away! This guy knows the last name!”
His eyebrows twitched at the moment, but J-Steen did not act recklessly as if he were a party to the incident.
“… … Free his men.”
As long as the mercenaries’ lifeless resistance could be felt through the Spirit Zone, they could not be released.
“Are you Amery Jaysteen?”
“okay. If you have something to say, say it to me.”
Like the woman at the counter, if this was a ruse, it was most accurate to check with her eyes.
“Show me the wound on your side.”
The kid struggled.
“Leader! Because it jumps! You child! Get this out quickly! You will kill me if I leave… … Aww!”
When the Shining Chain was tightened, everyone screamed, and all those connected by the chain frowned.
“Huhhhh!”
Jaysteen shouted.
“stop!”
Grabbing the lower hem of her jacket, she pulled it up to her neck, revealing her bare skin as her chest swayed.
“All right? Now release the men.”
“Dae, boss… … .”
While the men looked away at the embarrassing sight, Shirone stared at her ribs.
‘there is.’
Wounds, which were probably fatal at the time, were clearly etched through the ribs.
“why? Shall I show you below?”
Shirone released the shining chain.
“Keuuugh!”
A woman fell from the ceiling, and his men knelt down and grabbed her aching body.
“It’s pitiful… … .”
J-Steen clicked his tongue, but he couldn’t hide the concern in his eyes.
‘He’s a strong person.’
I could feel the spirit of a soldier crossing the line of fire.
“Yes, I am Amery Jaysteen. What are you going to do now? Are you going to kill me?”
“I keep saying, I’m not here to fight. I have no intention of harming you.”
“okay?”
J-Steen seemed uninspired.
“Okay, let’s listen. You want to talk alone, right? Then there’s a perfect place.”
It was the shooting range where she lived.
“Leader! we’ll follow you! Aww!”
The one-eyed man jumped to his feet, but the bone throbbing pain forced him to sit down again.
“I am taking care of myself. Anyway, no fuss… … .”
After Jasein and Shirone exited through the back door, the woman at the counter brought some ointment.
“Put this on. I lost weight.”
Aekku, who was applying medicine to his body, looked at the chain marks on his skin and frowned.
“shit! I should wear long sleeves. How do you get along like this? Anyone who sees it will know you’re a pervert.”
The man with the long sword turned to the back door.
“Are you okay? I’m not usually good at it. Wouldn’t it be nice if we followed along?”
“Heh, average skills?”
said the black-haired man.
“Do you think you can beat me with your normal skills? Well, if it’s you guys, it’s possible.”
He showed his teeth.
“What is this child! I’m already disturbed, but I’m going to salt people.”
“If you’re going to kill me, that means you’ve already killed me.”
Everyone shut up.
“If you had an evil mind, we wouldn’t be here right now. That’s why the captain obeyed obediently. Just trust me.”
“… … .”
I blew on the part of the shoulder where I had applied the ointment.
“Will there be no scars?”
The explosion of magic bullets exploded.
“next!”
When the target was set halfway up the mountain, the sniper gun undoubtedly recoiled.
“next!”
Shirone was lost in thought while watching Jay Steen, who was absorbed in shooting training, from the side.
‘What are you shooting at?’
It was a marksmanship that could not be obtained without training every day, close to divine.
‘I’m still fighting.’
Jaysteen’s words finally opened.
“If you’re not a hitman, why are you here?”
“I have a favor to ask you.”
“ask? to me?”
When the bolt was pulled, the side of the sniper gun slammed and the shells vomited.
“Please kill Harvits.”
Her breathing stopped and her shoulders began to shake like a tsunami.
“All, next!”
As soon as the target stood, he pulled the trigger, but the magic bullet exploded in an unexpected place.
“Haviz… … .”
Fear flashed in Jaysteen’s eyes.

When Shirone and Jaysteen returned to the guild, their subordinates were busy restoring the building they had damaged.
Even though there was such a great uproar, no one came close except for the acquaintances of the guilds around them.
It was a guild with many incidents, but Shirone was convinced that the guards were at fault.
“it’s okay. Everyone stop moving.”
The woman at the counter, sniffing in sorrow, stopped cleaning when Jasein said.
“Ah, damn it!”
While attaching the boards with a hammer that didn’t even work, he threw the hammer out of anger.
‘You broke everything.’
I said I wasn’t willing to fight like that
“Okay, are you done talking? It should be a case that does not require compensation for damages.”
J-Steen said to the black-haired man.
“Guild members, that is to say, summon all the bastards who are hanging out somewhere and come to Mr. Garder’s inn. talk there.”
“yes.”
As the black-haired man quickly jumped away, she turned to Shirone.
“We die together and live together. These are the kids I’ve been hanging out with since the beginning of the exile. What you said to me, you should be able to say the same to them.”
“of course.”
As Shirone and Jaysteen left the building, two men with long swords scratched their heads and looked at them.
“What the hell is going on, is it so serious?”
Shirone, who rented the largest room at Mr. Garder’s inn, told the eight mercenaries about everything.
“therefore… Does that Habits want the captain to assassinate the emperor of the Gustav Empire?”
“Exactly.”
the kid asked
“Are you crazy?”
“I don’t think that would be a bad suggestion.”
Shirone looked back at Jaysteen.
“You can’t hide forever. If you want to break this cycle of evil, now is your chance.”
She still didn’t answer.
“I am not saying you should do everything. All preparations will be made by our team, the best of the best.”
“Then what do you want from me?”
I really wanted to know.
“Hatred. We need your hatred.”
“Hate… … .”
Jaysteen remembers the long life of running away from Harvits without missing a single moment.
‘Of course I hate it.’
Crawled, beaten, and sometimes killed.
It was an environment more impoverished than wild beasts, and before meeting the crew, it was a lonely life rather than a criminal.
‘I want to kill him!’
Her teeth clenched as she clenched her fists.
‘Havitz
However, the moment I imagined the appearance of an evil spirit that I had never seen before, I was overcome with fear as if my internal organs were melting.
“Huh!”
It was missed, of course, but as a result, Harvits destroyed everything but her.
Parents, brothers, sisters, even families of families, brothers and sisters of those families… … .
‘It wasn’t murder. It was bombing.’
There were times when I wanted to know why this disaster came to us.
However, when he found out that he was probably the only survivor in the world who had escaped from Havitz’s clutches.
‘plural? How dare you be like me?’
I tried to calm it down by holding on to my shaking wrist, but the more I tried, the more the trembling got worse.
‘scared.’
Harvits was so scared that he went crazy.
“Leader… … .”
While looking at him pitifully, J-Steen hit the back of his hand countless times.
“damn! damn!”
And when the extinction finally subsided, he glared at Shirone with cool eyes.
“see? this is my reality Let alone kill, I can’t even fire a gun in this state.”
“I don’t need a gun.”
Jasein’s eyebrows twitched.
“Didn’t I say that it was I who killed Havitz?”
“yes. But I will use a dagger.”
“What bullshit? i am a sniper Melee tactics are not my specialty, and even daggers… … .”
“No, it’s a sniping.”
Shirone stopped talking.
“The distance to Harvits would be at least 120 kilometers away. You are not in any danger.”
“… … Nothing shoots that far.”
“So I told you, what we need is hate. You can shoot.”
I couldn’t understand Shirone’s words from earlier.
‘No, what this guy is saying is probably right.’
Even so, the reason why they don’t understand is that he came from a world they have not experienced.
Aekku said.
“Let’s do it, Captain. This is your chance. It doesn’t matter to us, but it’s a waste of the captain’s skills to rot here.”
As long as the mercenary group was organized under the name of J. Steen, it would have been far off to expand the force.
“Let’s make a cool decision and go out into the real world. furthermore… … .”
He said with his cheeks blushing.
“The captain doesn’t have to go to the wedding house.”
Everyone turned around at the sudden sound, and the woman at the counter asked absurdly.
“I hope you captain… … .”
“What nonsense! Even though I only have one eye, I can clearly see what a woman looks like!”
Jasein turned his head.
“okay? Do you have any thoughts on me?”
One of Aku’s eyes was wide open.
“Jin, really?”
“Of course not. Nonungsin.”
“… … .”
Jysteen, who made her mouth shut, looked back at Shirone and said.
“Okay, let’s say I killed Havits. But what next? Who will protect us who assassinated the emperor of the empire?”
“ah… … .”
I had such a problem.
“That is, of course, in Kashan… … .”
The table trembled with a bang.
“gibberish. Another life of escape for risking one’s life? I’m tired of living while noticing high things.”
Shirone understood her.
“Then is there anything else you want?”
“Hmm, to answer that, I need to ask you something first. what the hell is your job title? Don’t even think about cutting it. Even in this commotion, not a single guard is around. I know it’s your work.”
“is it so. I am a wizard belonging to the Ivory Tower.”
“Ivory Tower?”
said the black-haired man.
“As far as I know is… … They say it’s a place where magic is researched.”
“Oh, what an amazing coincidence. I learned that in kindergarten too.”
When Jay Steen sarcastically said, the black hair shrugged.
“It is said to be higher than the king.”
“good.”
Sensing Shirone’s social status, Jaysteen twisted her posture and began negotiations.
“Listen. The Jaysteen mercenaries are a minority, but they are the elite. It’s funny to say this after being hurt by you, but… … .”
“no. They were all excellent.”
“It would be quicker if you knew. Join Arachne’s best mercenary guild, Guardian King. Of course, it’s not just sign up. At least you should give me the position of leader.”
“That’s a bit… … .”
“This is not a parachute. It’s a worthy reward for what we’ve been holding our breath for so far.”
Yahweh is omnipotent, but he cannot force someone else to sacrifice for someone else’s gain.
“I lived in a guild for a while. We value contribution as much as skill. There will be trouble in the guild.”
Because it’s not just the Jysteen mercenaries that are united in a tight camaraderie.
“what? What are you talking about when you can’t even do that much?”
Jaysteen lost her temper.
“To be clear, I will never do business with anything other than the Guardian King. This is a fight for my life.”
“Hmm.”
Silverling must have collapsed in Radum, and the only guild I could ask for personally was the Parrot Mercenary Corps.
“Sister Marsha… … .”
“what?”
When Shirone came to his senses and raised his head, the members of J. Steen were staring at him with their eyes wide open.
“What did you just say? Marsha? Clay Marsha?”
“yes. Do you know the Parrot Mercenary Corps?”
Rather, J-Steen was taken aback.
“Of course you know. Parrots are one of the top 10 mercenary guilds in the world. fallen mother. Who doesn’t know Marsha on this floor?”
‘Top 10 guilds in the world?’
It was an achievement achieved 4 years after leaving Galliant.
‘Well, it’s because he’s a smart person.’
In return for helping Miro in Undercoder, it seemed that he had properly rolled the enormous support he received from Uorin.
‘Yes, if it’s a parrot, it’s possible.’
Our Lady of the Fall, Clay Marsha.
If she was the godmother of the abandoned Seungnyangs, she would open the way for the Jysteen Mercenary Corps.
“great. Let me introduce you to the parrot mercenaries. I would also like to offer the manager position. So, did you make a deal with this?”
“No. What kind of deal do you do this? Of course, after confirming that Marsha has declined.”
J-Steen twirled her fingers.
“I heard that they were stationed in the Iron Kingdom not too long ago, but it’s so new to me. You’d better come to me as soon as possible. Because I might change my mind.”
Convinced that she had the initiative, she looked at Shirone’s reaction, raising the corners of her mouth.
“You don’t have to go looking for it yourself.”
Shirone asked calmly.
“if… Is there a Terraforce Church nearby?”
* * *
As a famous exile country, many religions coexisted in Arachne.
The Church of Terra Force was also small, but it had a temple on the outskirts of Bengal and was recruiting followers.
“excuse me.”
Shirone grabbed the priest and greeted him.
“welcome. May the grace of Terraforce be with you. How can I help you?”
“Do you truly believe in Terraforce?”
Channeling is difficult unless you are in a trance state.
“of course. The great god Terraforce guides all humans to goodness. A group of people who dismiss it as evil… … .”.
“Then please change those shoes.”
“yes? what now… … .”
When the priest frowned in disrespect, Shirone sighed and said,
“Chief Justice, are you listening?”
At the same time, the priest shuddered and looked up at the sky, revealing the whites of his eyes.
“Hexa, this abortion case was lucky. If I hadn’t filibustered in Congress… … .”
It seemed like there was a lot to talk about.
“Oh, I will talk about that later. There is something I want to say to a person named Clay Marsha. I’m in a hurry.”
“… … What is it?”
The Supreme Court Justice in the priest’s voice showed a hint of disappointment, but Shirone didn’t care and continued.
2 hours later.
A tavern in Iron Kingdom.
The executives of the parrot mercenary corps, who rented the entire building for three days, were drunk from daylight.
The door rattled open as their godmother, Marsha, tidied her claws in a corner.
“Leader. Captain Marsha.”
The vice-captain of the 10th division came in holding onto the back of a boy with a white ball head who was thrilled.
one of the officers asked.
“what’s the matter? If you’re here to borrow a drink, get out.”
“No, that’s not it. This guy must have had his daytime drink wrong, he sighs and talks nonsense.”
The white-headed boy said.
“It’s not bullshit. I saw God, God gave me a revelation.”
“Come here, my sweet little boy.”
Marsha called the white-headed boy and diagnosed his mental state by lowering his eyes.
“Have you not taken any medicine? What was your dream?”
“My great god told me to tell the captain this. We must go to Arachne right now.”
Marsha smoked a cigarette and laughed.
“what? Do the gods even recognize my beauty? Did you even ask me to enter the beauty pageant?”
“If you are over 30, you won’t even accept the papers.”
Marcia, who pursed her lips at Freeman’s words, hugged the boy’s neck and said,
“Yes, my little one. Why is that great god telling me to go to Arachne?”
“Hey, you said this.”
The boy didn’t miss a word.
“There, Hexa, no Yahweh, no Shirone is waiting.”
“… … Hmm.”
She pulled the boy back, lost in thought, then let out a long puff of cigarette smoke.
“What god stutters?”

“Day! It’s a thing!”
When Jaysteen burst open the guild door and entered, his subordinates were sleeping on the floor of the collapsed building.
“Everyone wake up, you bastards!”
Six men and one woman raised their upper bodies without fixing their boisterous expressions.
“Oh, it hurts. Why is it so noisy in the morning?”
Feeling the body odor of the vomit he had made last night, he frowned and looked back at J-Steen.
“what? from morning?”
Jaysteen put magic bullets on the gun.
“Is that what a guy who earns a living in my guild would do?”
The moment I checked the gun’s muzzle, the dazed faces opened their eyes and fled their bodies.
“Bounce! Die!”
Those scattered in all directions closed their eyes tightly in anticipation of the explosion of magic bullets.
“It’s a job. please.”
Jaysteen sighed and lowered the gun.
Inside the guild, which was roughly covered with wooden planks, all members of the J-Steen mercenary group sat at a round table.
“So, we ended up protecting the world’s most obsessed girls?”
Aekku asked in bewilderment.
“okay. Of course, I’m the only one who can enter the waiting room. The six of you will act as outside security.”
With the blackmailer unable to be caught, the government of Arachne devoted all their energy to security.
It was a situation where we had to use even the power we didn’t have, and the fact that J-Steen was a woman also helped.
the woman at the counter asked.
“How much money did you give me?”
“It’s an achievement. But the down payment alone is enough for the guild maintenance. Besides, if this job succeeds, the value of the name of the mercenary group will rise.”
One of his eyes was shining.
“I mean… … Are you saying you’re finally going out into the world?”
It is the resurrection of the Jaysteen mercenaries.
“okay. It was decided in a hurry, but I’ll be able to make it in time for rehearsal. Briefing in the clearing in 10 minutes.”
* * *
At the venue of the World Beauty Contest, there was a separate waiting room for participants and event officials.
“Whoa. Whoa.”
Maya, who had just made her debut, sighed heavily as she sat in the waiting room for invited singers.
‘Why are you doing this? My heart beats too fast.’
The agency’s representative, Palmus, came into the waiting room and handed Maya a sedative.
“Still?”
“yes. but… … It will be fine.”
As many people worked hard for today, I couldn’t show my weakness.
“calm down. You worked hard. There was no mistake during rehearsal. You will do well.”
‘I should have made a mistake.’
The fact that it was finished neatly made me even more anxious because it was my first professional stage.
‘Shirone… … .’
Maya opened the sheet music with the title of the song ‘Rain of Light’ written on it.
‘Someday you’ll listen to my song.’
It means that light poured from the sky like showers, and it was a song that expressed the feelings of being in love with Shirone.
Seeing Maya noticeably calm down as she read the lyrics, Palmus licked his lips.
‘I don’t know who it is, but I’m blessed.’
When they first read the lyrics she submitted, everyone involved knew that they weren’t just words for lyrics.
‘Yes, this is just the beginning. All you need is to throw away your greed and throw out your heart.’
Falmus quietly avoided the seat.
participant waiting room.
The room where the beauties representing 32 countries gathered together was a silent battlefield.
The thoughts of the female guards were the same.
‘It won’t be easy to control.’
said Miss Weiden, who was sitting cross-legged in her undergarments, annoyed.
“Haa, boring.”
There was no answer coming back, and it was suffocating for her love of socializing.
‘If I could smoke a cigarette, I wouldn’t have a wish.’
The surveillance network of the competitors was spread over everyone, so it was impossible to sneak up on smoking.
Baring her armpits and yawning profusely, she turned to Miss Tormia, who was sitting next to her.
It was a woman with raw blonde hair that came down to the left and right, revealing a tall forehead, and beautiful eyebrows like pure gold.
“Hey, it’s still a long way to start, isn’t it stuffy when you’re wearing a dress? You have to change anyway.”
said Alfred Forney closing the book.
“The dignity of royalty knows no time or place.”
“Oh my, are you royalty?”
In the graduation exam at Tormia Magic School, she was unfortunately eliminated due to Maya’s eating out of the rules, and she applied for a leave of absence.
‘This is the best I can choose.’
It was a shock to fail the exam, but the world came to know about her family’s rape of Shirone.
‘If I win, I can enter the vested interest.’
In any country, the winner of a beauty pageant will receive preferential treatment from the government, which will be directly related to the political power of the royal family.
“Hey, are you really royalty? So why do good-looking people just cringe at you?”
Pony, who didn’t feel the value of responding, was about to open the book again, but a hand came in front of her eyes.
When I looked up, Miss Arachne was approaching me with a refreshing smile.
“nice to meet you. I am Barho Rangi.”
The kingdom of Arachne has produced many world championship winners from generation to generation, and Rangi was also a strong candidate for the championship.
“It’s Alfred Pony. I can’t say I’m happy.”
“Whoops, that’s straightforward. Are you sure you’re a wizard?”
Perhaps everyone would have obtained the participants’ profiles, but it was a painful past for Pony.
“I am not a wizard. Because I didn’t graduate.”
Pointing out the facts meant that her way of thinking still couldn’t escape the magician’s.
“know. I still think it’s cool.”
She was a woman who had a knack for making people feel comfortable.
“Hmm.”
When Pony made a sign of liking, Rangi brought a chair and sat down in front of her.
“You said you were going to Alpheas Magic School, right? then… … Do you know someone named Shirone?”
Emotions were revealed for the first time on Pony’s cold face.
“How do you know Shirone?”
“Huh, of course you know. Who in the world does not know the stars of the ivory tower?”
“but… … .”
The Ivory Tower is an unfamiliar institution to outsiders of magic, but Pony identified with her.
“What kind of person is Shirone?”
“What kind of person are you?”
Her eyes, as she rested her chin on her chin and recalled her school days, turned into deep sadness.
“Actually, we weren’t very close. Sometimes, to the extent of exchanging a few words at a restaurant. Rather, there were more fights.”
“Wow, did you fight that Shirone?”
I felt good for some reason.
“Because it was a competitor at the time. But it was only after the graduation exams that things went wrong. Shirone is from a commoner.”
added Pony.
“Of course, magic has nothing to do with status. It’s a world where you can push yourself through only with your skills.”
The fierce eyes subsided again.
“My family, the royal family, made a mistake. For just that reason, they eliminated Shirone, who was the top scorer, and put pressure on me to pass.”
‘Anyway, politicians… … .”
Is there a machine that can print the same?
“It was embarrassing. So she didn’t go anywhere. The case got worse. Eventually I… … .”
Pony said bitterly.
“I have decided to commit suicide.”
Rangi’s eyes widened, and Miss Biden, who was listening next to her, hurriedly whispered.
“Hey, what if I say something like that? How many ears do you have here?”
It would be a decisive blow if the tooth part leaked out, but Pony continued talking without wavering.
“I tied a rope to the ceiling and hung it around my neck.”
None of the participants responded, but the sound of speech completely disappeared.
“I pushed the chair away and left my body to gravity. But the moment it fell down, it stopped.”
Rangi swallowed his saliva.
“It was strange, so I slowly opened my eyes and looked down, but Shirone was holding my leg. The guy who put me down looked right at me and said this.”
Pony’s words were extremely calm.
“It’s not your fault, Pony.”
Everyone was looking at her now.
“It wasn’t something I said to comfort myself. Because it’s really not my fault. She was about to lose her wizard license, let alone the chief, and that’s what she said.”
Pony still couldn’t believe it.
“What kind of person is Shirone? It’s simple. Wizard. And he is the greatest wizard of our time.”
“You still like magic.”
“I wanted to do it all the way. But I want to believe in myself a little more. I think that would be the order.”
Endless battles and competitions, a cold borderline world where no one appeals to emotion.
But looking back, I wondered if it was the most comforting time in Pony’s life.
“Miss you. school… … .”
The first smile appeared on Pony’s lips, and the listening competitors turned their heads.
‘Sheesh, I can’t use that.’
If it was a shame, I would shed it, but if it was a drama like that, it only enhanced Pony’s charm.
‘The archmage who defeats the dragon.’
Rangi still had the novella that Shirone had left at the hotel.
“You are a wonderful person, Shirone.”
Pony laughed.
“Yes, when you are a wizard… … To be honest, I can’t deny it either. But if you see it in person, you will be amazed. Because he’s a country boy who’s usually flawless.”
Although the situations in which they understood each other were different, it seemed that Rangi knew what he meant.
‘When you’re a wizard. What would it look like?’
While Rangi was lost in his imagination, the guards who inspected the surrounding area entered again.
The captain of the guard introduced Jaysteen.
“I am an emergency sniper expert this time. This will further enhance your safety, so you can participate in the competition with peace of mind.”
Those who knew about the terrorist threat were a minority even in the capital.
“What kind of sniper expert? Honestly, who would shoot us from afar? I don’t know if I catch you.”
Jaysteen said.
“It’s not just men who are the villains in the world. This is a measure to be sure, so please follow the control.”
“Oh, I don’t know, I don’t know! You can control what you eat, drink, and even breathe. What kind of control is that?”
Confidentiality was a priority, so persuasion was impossible.
“From now on, the world’s grand festival! Let the finals of the world beauty pageant begin!”
Received applause from the audience, the moderator exited, and the opening ceremony celebration continued.
“Maya, tension is poison, but you can’t put it down too much. Trust me. You can do it.”
It was Maya’s turn.
“I am introducing! I am Maya, the owner of excellent singing skills from Tormia!”
I took a deep breath and stood alone in full view of the crowd, and my mind went giddy.
‘Let’s stay calm. You’ve done something even harder than this.’
It reminded me of my magic school days.
‘Yes, I’m not alone.’
The appearance of the players arranging the instruments felt like the Shirone team that fought together during the highland occupation.
‘Bomb drum, Eruki.’
As soon as the majors and instruments were arranged, they smiled.
‘The red-faced keyboard Amy. Nade is perfect for an electric guitar. And the base… … .’
Shirone, who always held the center of the team.
‘someday… … Can we play together?’
The prelude to the song “Rain of Light,” which she wrote, flowed, and she felt the eyes of a thousand people focus on her.
“Whoa! thank god. It’s not too late.”
The moment Shirone, who arrived late, sat down, Maya stepped slowly to match the beat.
“It’s really cool, Maya. You have achieved your dream.”
I couldn’t hear Shirone’s voice, but Maya’s movement from side to side stopped abruptly.
“What, what? Why are you here?”
Falmus, watching from backstage, immediately realized that the situation was not normal.
“Shirone.”
At first, I wondered if I was seeing an illusion, but the person sitting in the first class was definitely Shirone.
‘Shirone is really here.’
There was no sound of music, no cheers from the audience, not even a heartbeat.

“it’s over. Totally ruined.”
Even though the previous week was almost over, Maya showed no signs of moving, so Falmus held his head.
‘Have I been eaten up by the tension?’
It was common for rookies to have their mind suddenly go blank and not be able to think of anything.
By the time Maya’s voice came out, Falmus, who couldn’t bear to look at reality, closed his eyes.
“Like a shower… … .”
A refreshing voice like the opening of the dawn.
“huh?”
Palmers opens his eyes, and the song begins as an intense drumbeat explodes.
“Light is coming down from the sky!”
The explosive singing power that cuts through the notes of all instruments burst out as if pushing the audience.
‘I got into a perfect berth. It’s much better than the rehearsal, isn’t it?’
Maya’s voice, surrendering to the rhythm before she knew it, was the most genuine I’d ever heard.
‘I’m not afraid.’
Because there can be no mistakes in sincerity.
‘Because I practiced countless times.’
I couldn’t think of anything, but the rhythm, the melody, and the time of the song flowed unconsciously.
“Like a sudden shower!”
As her ears gradually opened and she could see the world, Shirone smiled like the lyrics of the song.
“The inevitable light pours down!”
I can’t clearly define how sincerity changes technology, but the audience certainly felt it.
“That singer, does he sing well?”
“I know. The other invited singers are also famous, and even though they are newcomers, the level is high.”
Shirone’s mouth itched at the people’s praise.
‘That person is my classmate.’
I thought I’d just have to watch her from afar until she climbed higher.
“The best! Maya!”
It was a splendid debut stage.
* * *
At a point eight miles (14 km) away from the assembly grounds, a group was moving at high speed.
Those who flew low with the power of the wind, those who ran only with muscle power, those who borrowed the power of machines.
Although the methods were varied, their speed, which can be called arrows, was almost equal.
“Mortasinger-sama, we will arrive at the venue soon.”
It was the language of heaven.
“good. Wait two kilometers away.”
A woman whose face was covered with a cloth with a drawing of a black cube spoke from the center of the crowd.
“You have to kill all the pretty things.”
He was Mortasinger (10,48 years old), 10th in the order of the Ten Commandments.
“The response will not be easy. World beauty pageants are Arachne’s main business.”
“Yes, it is a country of subregions. It’s nothing for us who ruled over the subjects of Heaven to worry about.”
La Enemy enlisted the Order of the Ten and the Eternal community to build an altar.
The reason was that it could easily permeate into the human world through reset, but Ra’s final choice was Nane.
‘Anyway, I don’t have that much responsibility.’
Veron and Baknyeo died, and Shura heard rumors that he became Nane’s disciple and was learning Buddhism.
‘If I had known it would be like this, I would have brought Yoo-jung from heaven. Then the situation would have already been over.’
Ranked 2nd in the Order of the Ten Commandments.
However, at the time, the apostasy was not permitted, so he would have been sleeping languidly, entrusting everything to his alter ego.
‘I don’t know! Now I’m going to do whatever I want.’
The other executives were also eccentric, so after Nane let go of Buddha, they scattered all over the world with only a handful of followers.
‘Just talk nonsense later!’
Mortasinger, who was responsible for the community alone, moved the organization with personal feelings.
‘It’s sad to be ugly, but do you hold a beauty contest? Anyway, the people of the subdivision are less distant!’
A man with a bulging belly and a tiger-like beard approached Mortasinger’s side.
“Is this fight meaningful?”
It was a man named Bodhidharma who had reached the level of Vajrapani, and behind him was the one-armed monk Hyega.
“… … .”
It wasn’t the traditional 3 subjects, but anyway, heaven was a place where countless alien species flowed in.
Above all, their level far surpassed Mortasinger, who was over 10,000 years old.
“If you find the meaning, that’s it. If you don’t intend to follow my will, get out of here.”
Other Eternals of the same level had already left the community following the leader of the Council of Ten Lords.
“Gudo is not somewhere else. We will be by your side.”
Mortasinger was the only cadre among the Tenrohoe who relied on eating out, rather than the state.
“You don’t have to sympathize. Because I am strong enough.”
The Ten Commandments are strong.
‘That’s why it’s a pity.’
A perfectly twisted human being.
Even Geumgangseung couldn’t destroy her diet.
* * *
On the first day of the competition, the representatives of each country were introduced, and the identities of the veiled women were revealed.
“everyone! This is Miss Weiden!”
Contrary to her yawning appearance in the waiting room, she appeared on stage like a shy girl.
“Wow! The best! After all, it’s Biden!”
Seeing her gently turn her head and blush, other participants gasped in vain.
‘Total pretense. Oh, my mouth is tickling to death.’
After a brief self-introduction and interview, it was Miss Tormia’s turn.
“uh? You should see this.”
Shirone, who was walking around the venue while checking the terrorist threat, stopped and stood on tiptoe.
“Don’t be alarmed! Miss Tormia this time is a royal family as befits a beauty representing the country!”
“royalty?”
“I am introducing! Alfred Pony!”
When the fully-dressed Pony walked onto the stage, the audience greeted her with cheers.
“Pony?”
On the other hand, Shirone opened her eyes wide.
“What about school?”
All kinds of thoughts crossed my mind, but the conclusion was that it was much more beautiful than when I was in school.
‘Maya and Pony. It’s embarrassing.’
Finally, when the representative of Arachne, the host country of the tournament, stepped forward, the loudest applause erupted.
“Rangi! Rangi!”
A man with hearts engraved in his eyes broke through the crowd and ran right under the stage.
“i love you!”
It was the man who held Shirone in the beauty pageant parade and delivered a long speech.
“oh?”
Rangi, accustomed to the stage, looked down without panic, but the bodyguards grabbed him.
“Pull it out! What are you doing!”
The moment I first saw Rangi, I realized it like fate.
“You are the person I was looking for!”
Shirone, who was watching the scene in bewilderment, suddenly turned around to feel the chill running down her spine.
“what?”
From a distance unrecognizable by the human eye, a clear intent to kill was fired in a straight line.
“It’s a sniping!”
Numerous iron marbles were flying into the arena from the side of the mountain.
‘That’s… … ?’
If Shirone’s eyes were accurate, the Akra was a weapon used by the subjects of Mecca.
“Get down!”
J-Steen, who was the only one keeping an eye on the ridge, saw the iron ball first and moved.
He pushed all the participants with his arms and threw them off the stage, but Rangi in the center could not escape.
“what… … ?”
Explosive orbs reached up to 200 meters in front, and I was distracted by the shelling that covered the sky.
“Mr. Rangi!”
The man who shook off the bodyguards went up to the stage and threw himself into Rangi as if to tackle him.
“Kyaaak!”
As she fell backwards, she saw hundreds of iron marbles spinning like a whirlpool in her eyes.
‘Is it a dream?’
When the brain, which intuitively felt death, activated the seesaw of time, particles of light bubbled like soap bubbles in the middle of the landscape.
‘city… … as… … .’
The light composes Shirone faster than the speed of thought.
‘… … yes?’
The marbles that received strong resistance began to light red flames like corn bursting.
‘As high as possible!’
Numerous orbs that rose up into the sky in a swirl like a dragon exploded at the same time.
“Aww! Terror!”
At the same time as the audience scattered in all directions due to the earth-shaking explosion, the guards activated the manual.
“Rangi, are you okay?”
When Shirone turned around, Rangi, who was dumbfounded, nodded involuntarily.
“Jaysteen! What about that one?”
J-Steen came up to the stage cleaning her ears.
“All is well. But this… … .”
Pony jumped out of nowhere.
“Shirone! Why are you here?”
“Are you? How are you doing at school?”
After choosing her words for a moment, she raised an eyebrow.
Jaysteen shouted.
“come!”
About 200 people were running fast from the point where the sniper-like shelling had been carried out.
Pony, who had been contemplating an answer until then, looked straight at Shirone with her eyes shining.
“It’s a tactical choice.”
“okay?”
The corner of Shirone’s mouth went up.
“You don’t need to protect me, do you?”
A rough stream of water shot up along Pony’s hands, then clumped together in the air.
“A horse?”
At the same time, Shirone teleported down the stage, and the Eternal community rushed in.
“Kill! I mean kill all pretty things!”
‘What is it?’
Just looking at the Mecca equipped with the Piper, it was clear that the subjects were the subjects, but the reason for the terror was too crude.
“It is a terrorist! Execute them all on the spot!”
The guards mobilized and fought back, but the skills of the Eternals were one to one hundred.
“ha ha ha! The pitiful people of the land!”
When those equipped with steel skeletons jumped around like springs and kicked, the armor cracked.
‘Perhaps a strength aid… … .’
The moment the pony grasped the mechanism and raised the water power, a sharp wind blew in.
“Aaaaa!”
Pony’s concentration skyrocketed at the sound of singing behind her back, and the water dragon, a shogi, caused a flood.
“wow.”
Rangi put on a dazed look at the sight of the huge flow of water covering the bladed wind and sweeping away even the Mecha people.
“What are you looking at? Are you also from military affairs? Grab something and get ready to fight quickly.”
Pony, who gave the instructions, looked back at Maya, who had just cast sound magic.
“Ah, there… … hi? how have you been doing?”
“Sheesh!”
It was not pleasant to reunite with the person who directly dropped Pony in the graduation exam.
“okay. Let’s get rid of it later, let’s fight for now.”
While a few came to their senses, most participants were terrified.
“Aaaaaagh! help me! What are the guards doing!”
“Take me! What kind of person am I! Fighting later and escaping from me first!”
Thinking it was Han that the audience didn’t hear, Rangi came to Pony’s side.
“When I saw them, they were very strong.”
There were guards guarding the stage in two or three layers, but it seemed like an instant to break through.
“Did you know Shirone?”
Rangi shrugged his shoulders.
“I know heaven helped. I don’t know which of the three of us came to meet… … .”
Although Pony’s prediction was wrong.
“At least I won’t die here.”
Where her gaze reached, Shirone was charging towards the enemy’s captain.
“What are you doing!”
A woman whose face was covered with a cloth painted with the symbol of Mecca flew into the sky and laughed.
“Knock-knock! why? Are you pissed off for bullying pretty kids?”
‘It ends in one shot.’
While loading the photon cannon, Bodhidharma and Hyega simultaneously attacked from the left and right sides.
‘strong!’
Bodhidharma, who fell down stronger than gravity, threw his fist straight out.
“Pungnyu Geumgangwon!”’
The wind pressure, as if the shape of a fist had been stamped out, hit Shirone as hard as iron.
‘It’s incarnation.’
With the sphere of Yahweh in her palm, Shirone raised her wind fist from bottom to top.
“Get out.”
With a popping sound, the Diamond Fist was released, and it permeated into the atmosphere in a huge way.
“huh?”
Bodhidharma’s eyes widened grotesquely.
‘It’s a golden fist because it can’t be solved. however… … .”
Hye Ga rushed.
“Keumgangseong.”
His body, which could transform anything it touched into adamantine, was covered in sharp diamonds.
“Stop! Hyega!”
A single flash of light hit Hye Ga’s stomach, and the diamond shattered in vain.
“Gagging!”
The face of Hye-ga, who opened her eyes in astonishment, was revealed, and Mortar Singer’s laughter stopped.
“Super unity?”
The ultimate in power that Mecha seeks.
And the Norse calls it Yahweh.

[795] Beta Fish (5)
“Aryan Shirone.”
It was the name of the only person in the world who could use super unification power.
‘Is it really possible?’
It was the sum of all the laws presumed to have existed at the moment when the universe turned on, that is, in the Planck era.
‘I won’t be able to compete with them.’
I don’t mean to disparage the skills of Bodhidharma and Hyega, but super unification was a rat poison to seekers.
‘I couldn’t destroy even the most correct Buddha. But what about eating out?’
The 10th rank of the Order of the Ten Commandments, the level is incomparable to the upper ranks, but in her mind, it was a completely different universe.
“Your Yahweh is not in me.”
Landing on the ground, Mortasinger charged towards Shirone and cast her magic.
“Hidden Peace.”
As the etheric waves spread, a huge mecha cube fell on Shirone’s head.
‘I can’t avoid it.’
Such a law, or equivalent exchange.
“Keugh!”
Shirone looked incomprehensible as her right hand disappeared.
“what… … !”
At the same time, the world split like a puzzle, and the bodily sensations began to get tangled up.
‘The world didn’t split.’
Shirone’s body, academically, was split.
“It started.”
Bodhidharma, who looked at Hyega’s condition, looked at Shirone as if he had turned a cube puzzle around.
Eating Out Rules Hidden Peace.
Mortasinger, based on etheric waves, can split the target into 98 cubes.
By taking one piece from there, the puzzle is completed, and the space is shuffled like a cube.
‘It’s Estas!’
Shirone recalled the structure of Mecca she had seen in heaven and the Istas of magic school at the same time.
When I focused my senses with my eyes moving toward my ankle, the block started to move.
‘Nerves are alive.’
There is no clear schema like inspection.
However, the human body schema of which organs should be where was laid in the unconscious.
“Ho-ho-ho! It’s futile!”
By the time Shirone managed to move one eye back to its original position, her lower body was in a mess.
In a situation where one side shuffled the puzzle and the other put it together, Shirone’s thinking accelerated.
‘I got it!’
The blocks rushing at Mortasinger started to regain their original form as they caused waves.
‘What do you think… … .’
Shirone, who trained his brain function all his life, had the world’s best thinking ability.
“Give me my hand.”
The puzzle was solved, but Mortar Singer still had the hidden piece in his right hand.
‘How do I unlock it?’
Due to the nature of eating out, there will be conditions, but before that, Morta Singer replaced Hidden Piece.
In the space divided into 98 equal parts, including the radius surrounding Shirone, the upper two eyes disappeared.
“it’s over!”
Just as Mortar Singer confirmed her victory, a single photon cannon rushed towards her.
Shirone’s brain, which had become Hidden Peace, emitted a special brain wave right before it was immersed in darkness.
‘It can’t be avoided.’
The speed of the Photon Cannon itself put the Mortar Singer in a state of Movement Zero.
‘Because it’s the best speed.’
There was only a fraction of a second left before the collision, but he was immersed in darkness, convinced of the law that had already been established.
“Kiyaaaa!”
Hastily releasing the hidden peace, she warped space with etheric waves and let the photon cannon flow.
‘also.’
When Shirone’s vision returned, he saw the collapsed Mortasinger clutching his shoulder.
‘Even if it’s the same etheric wave, its realm is shallower than that of the vocal sound.’
It was a completely different matter how much an unbeliever could twist the law.
‘Rian would have avoided it.’
Lian’s belief breaks the entire world’s laws.
“Shirone!”
Shirone’s spirit zone expanded rapidly at the sound of a call from the stage.
‘Is it the limit?’
I kept watching during the battle, but the guards could no longer protect the stage and opened the way.
“Kyaaaagh! come! come!”
As the Eternals rushed in, Jaysteen stood in their way and the contestants made a fuss.
“What the hell are you doing! Take all the money and eat it! Aren’t you supposed to protect us!”
Even if they shouted, the already mutilated guards could not help them.
“Wake! We protect our bodies!”
Pony, who received Maya’s support, struggled to raise water power, but the power of Norse’s collective magic exceeded her.
“Why do we protect our bodies! It’s a body that someone made for good! I mean get up quickly!”
When the Eternals came up on stage, it was a big fight in an instant, and even J-Steen couldn’t use his strength.
‘Really strong, these guys… … .’
It was not a world beauty contest, but they were talented people who could cause national terrorism.
“Kyayayayayaya!”
As the Kergos raised their bent swords and screamed, Rangi kicked off the ground and sprang out.
“no!”
Rangi’s teeth clenched together.
‘I don’t even know how to schema… … .’
The moment Kergoin flew like a hawk and kicked, Kergoin’s upper body bent like rubber.
“… … hey?”
Rangi’s face went blank at the speed he couldn’t even see with his eyes even though he was moving close by.
“The tribes of the weak land.”
The moon sword flashed, and Rangi’s body was pushed back with terrifying momentum.
Where Kergoin looked, frowning, Shirone was hugging her.
“are you okay?”
“uh? no, that’s… … .”
I had seen Shirone a few days ago, but the cold energy in her eyes was the first time in my life.
“hey! Shirone!”
cried the pony.
“You must have told me to stop these guys! This is not at the level of a criminal!”
“You blocked it anyway.”
As Pony gritted her teeth, the barrier of water gushed out and poured down.
“You do it now.”
As close to 200 people took over the stage, Shirone jumped out.
As the flash of the shotgun movement spread like a net, the array of Eternals collapsed in an instant.
“wow… … .”
Everyone was stunned by the sight of the enemies who were unable to catch i people even when the guards rushed at them.
Flashes of light rained down, and the number of Eternals dropped from 200 to 100 and then to 50 again.
‘Pony, you lied.’
Rangi had his eyes on Shirone, who was moving through enemy lines as if electricity were moving.
‘You said you couldn’t deny it?’
When she was a wizard, Shirone radiated the most beautiful light in the world.
“Mortasinger, please go back.”
Bodhidharma came closer, supporting Hyega.
“I don’t know why it’s here, but it’s a Hexa that other executives couldn’t use their hands on. You can’t win.”
“joy! Who won?”
Anyway, the youngest member of the Ten Commandments, he didn’t care about the depth of his realm or his magical skills.
“I mean kill them!”
beautiful things in the world.
“Hidden Peace!”
As the regulation eating out was triggered again, the entire stage was divided into 98 blocks.
In the process of being jumbled like a puzzle, blocks with participants were pushed in front of her.
“I will burn your face!”
As she lit a fire in her hands, she rushed into space, sparks flew from Shirone’s eyes in the distance.
With a pop, the flames engulfed the participants.
“Kyaaak! save people… … !”
1 second to here.
‘Time Vibration!’
And when that one second vibrated without knowing the end, this time Mortar Singer grabbed his head and screamed.
“What, what?”
As one second of repetition was included in one second, the world was divided into countless blocks in the eyes of the participants.
After the section where information danced in huge waves, the world gradually began to take shape.
‘Found it, the last puzzle.’
The back of Shirone, who had her back to Mortasinger, caused a ripple as if gushing out, and the situation was reversed.
“Who are you?”
If the source of trauma is beauty, the condition for lifting the ban is to reveal one’s face.
As the wind cutter headed for Mortasinger’s face, the hidden piece was released and the scenery returned.
“no! Don’t look!”
Losing her will to fight, she flew towards the mountain, and Bodhidharma and Hyega followed.
“Now! Arrest!”
Listening to the sound of the guards capturing the terrorists, Shirone looked towards the mountain.
‘Eternal community. Have I lost my way?’
Ankera’s disappearance would have been like being abandoned by God.
‘I couldn’t seem to find the meaning to fight.’
Except for one person.
‘In terms of the strength of his abilities, he is at least a figure comparable to the Order of the Ten Commandments. But why would you do this?’
The more I thought about it, the more I couldn’t understand it.
* * *
The evening newspaper was an extra for a long time.
A newspaper headlined the terrorism of the world beauty pageant, and people’s attention was focused on it.
“Whoa, it’s not a fuss.”
When Jysteen returned to the guild, Shirone, who was having a meal with the members, asked.
“How have you been? What did the organizers say?”
“Contest follow-up. It seems that most of the terrorists were caught and eaten by the superiors.”
Shirone was bewildered.
“But you still have it, right? Also a terrorist instigator. Are you still continuing the competition?”
“Because it makes money. you know?”
“What about the participants?”
For the first time, J-Steen showed signs of being tired.
“I thought your ears were bleeding. Asking for psychological counseling, prescribing psychiatric medication, etc.”
I imagined it even without seeing it.
“Are you going to do it gently?”
“What can I do? It’s not just picking pretty people. Making the world peaceful with beauty is the official slogan. Anyone who runs away from here will be criticized.”
Shirone remembered the street demonstrations.
“There are quite a few people who watch the competition closely. It will be a great opportunity for them.”
“okay. So I do… … .”
Jaysteen sighed.
“They say you must protect me. When I deliver an official statement, I never do it without that handsome guy.”
“I can’t. I also have acquaintances. Please insert it.”
Jaysteen shook her head.
“No, they want you to take full responsibility to protect them. So you should be in the waiting room too. I even want to accompany you to the bathroom, shower, and restaurant.”
Shirone’s eyes widened.
“yes? Are you crazy? am i a man? What if I accept such a request? Besides, tomorrow is swimsuit day!”
Then you go and tell me yourself! What are the grown-up virgins saying, mother, mother, and weeping? I don’t believe in the guard or anything else! I’m in complete panic!”
A grunt sounded from Shirone’s throat.
“I will read it.”
“You know that. but it won’t work Who you are has already spread among the contestants. There is no human being who will refuse to be protected by the world’s best wizard.”
My head was already pounding.
“Everyone will stay in the bunker tonight, but the problem is tomorrow when the tournament resumes. What are you going to do? The guards seem to want you to do it too. Isn’t it fun to hear? The terrorists this time are the ones who unleashed demons all over the world?”
It was an organization that destroyed the special forces of each country.
“… … all right. I will.”
The participating countries heard the news and would quickly take action, but Shirone was the only one to protect the stage right away.
“Here you are.”
He put his hand on Shirone’s shoulder.
“if… … Don’t you need an assistant?”
Turning her head, Shirone read the bright eyes of the other members.
“Yes, there is no need.”
Shirone sighed resolutely and lowered Aku’s hand.

[796] Complex (1)
“excuse me.”
After breakfast, the members of the J-Steen Guild, who were about to leave for the event, turned to the uninvited guests.
“If I have something to do, I should excuse myself. But who are you?”
It was a woman with a stern impression that looked good with big glasses and bobbed hair.
“Isn’t this the J-Steen Guild?”
Aekku acted as a representative.
“Of course, this is J-Steen… … Ugh!”
I was going to joke about it, but when a pale man with shaved eyebrows entered, I hurriedly backed away.
“What are you doing in a place like this?”
As Freeman looked around, four top officers of the parrot mercenary entered one after another.
‘Coriander.’
All prayers were unusual.
In the end, Jasein got up from his seat and asked questioningly.
“What are you guys? They’ve been attacking other people’s guilds since morning.”
Marsha burst out laughing.
“Anyway, if you called someone, you should have organized the ranks. Miss, do you know who we are?”
“I don’t know, but I think I know. I’ve never seen a proper guy for a human who speaks those lines.”
Marsha raised her index finger.
“sympathy. But make an exception this time. If they are also people who live in the same world as us.”
“Hmph, that sound… … .”
Just as J-Steen was about to start walking, Shirone opened the back door and came in after taking a bath outdoors.
“uh? Marsha’s sister. When did you come?”
Marsha narrowed her eyes as she watched as she ripped off her hair with a towel.
“Hmm.”
Undercoder’s Shirone was just a copy of the information, so after all, it’s been 4 years since I broke up with Galliant.
‘It’s grown a lot.’
He had the naive impression of a seventeen-year-old, but his temperament was much sharper.
Shirone, who hung the towel on the chair, rushed over and took Marsha’s hand.
“It’s been a while.”
Marsa put Syrone’s neck around her arm.
“you! You called me in a strange way! What the hell is it? Even if you try to refuse, you don’t get a reply!”
“Aww! There was a situation!”
Marsha, who pulled Syrone by the neck, looked back at Freeman and smiled.
“circumstances? All the stars say that this is all big.”
The Jaysteen mercenaries, who were watching the commotion, narrowed their eyes as if they had come to their senses.
“No way, parrot mercenaries?”
Marsha said to Jaysteen.
“okay. I came because there was someone who wanted to see me like crazy. Who is it?”
“I meant to see you. I have something to ask of you.”
While Shirone was conveying the full story with a voice of arrogance, J. Steen stared at Marsha.
‘This woman… … .’
Our Lady of All Outcasts
‘I have a nasty personality.’
I don’t know what kind of relationship he had with Shirone, but the magnanimity of wielding the Five Stars like a gangster wouldn’t discriminate against anyone.
“Hmm, that’s how it happened… … .”
After hearing the explanation, Marsha approached the table, and everyone at the table moved away.
Sitting alone in a chair, Marsha took out a cigarette, bit her lips, and waved her hand at Shirone.
“fire.”
There was a debt I owed from Undercorder, and since I was in a position to ask for help, I couldn’t help but listen.
‘Really, this older sister never changes.’
Marsha, who lit a cigarette on the fire Yahweh had made, put it between her fingers and let out a long puff of smoke.
“good. Jaysteen Guild, accept it. Whether it’s Harvits or whatever, if we become a family, we’ll go all the way.”
“Thank you, hehe.”
Marsha had no choice but to burst into laughter at the unprecedented Nucksal.
‘This guy is now an adult too.’
Still, he was like a younger brother.
“In exchange, there are conditions on this side as well. It’s not particularly great, but I think it’ll be faster to go through you.”
“What is it?”
Marsha’s expression became serious for the first time.
“Do you know about Fermi?”
It was not strange for Marsha to know since they had a history of fighting together in Undercoder.
“no. I only heard that you left after the graduation exam. What happened after that… … .”
“He, do you know what an alias is on this floor?”
Marsha lit a cigarette.
“Shin Hong drug lord.”
Shirone’s mouth gaped blankly.
“The central continent has already been eaten and it is spreading to the southern continent. The lower the addictiveness, the higher the unit price. Surprisingly, this worked. Ordinary people also get their hands on it. It was to attack the people’s fear of demons.”
“But why drugs? If you need money, you can do it with a transaction of depreciation… … .”
“You fool, it’s because you don’t know this floor, it’s not at that level. The down payment I made with the Empress of Kasan is already paid off.”
Even so, it was something I couldn’t understand.
‘Is it broken?’
Did the magician’s faith and Yogi’s will be lost due to the shock of the graduation exam?
“How did you know, sister?”
“As the power of the parrot grows, people of all kinds come in. A few of them seem to have dabbled in drugs. As you know, our mercenaries are strictly prohibited from taking drugs.”
As Marsha beckoned, a dark-skinned man with wide shoulders approached.
It was Shake (Rat, Tiger), leader of the 3rd Division of the Parrot Mercenary Corps.
“nice to meet. It’s called Shake.”
After a brief introduction, he rolled up his forearm and showed the hieroglyph meaning rat engraved on his left arm.
“I am a warrior of the Wen people. Selected warriors can have two of the twelve animals engraved on their bodies.”
It was a kind of shamanism.
“To be exact, one out of six for combat and one out of six for support. Rats can trigger tunnel sights. It can bend the direction of light.”
I thought it was amazing.
“I can see inside this ceiling, for example. It’s not clairvoyance. Follow the crack in the floor, climb up the drain and go through the ventilation system to see it. In any case, in this way, suspicious subordinates were carefully monitored. And I found the coins of the drug dealers. It looks like this.”
Shake took out the coin and noticed it immediately.
“The golden ring… … .”
Ting and flipped the coin, he snatched it in the middle.
“I know too. It took me a month to find out where this sentence was used. It is the pattern he used at the magic school in Tormia, that is, Fermi’s alma mater.”
It will be Fermi.
‘It’s not like someone stole it. She can’t expand her drug routes at this rate unless it’s him,’
Shirone clenched both fists.
“Fermi, you really… … .”
No matter how bright it was, I didn’t know how to do business using drugs that lead to human destruction.
Marsha said.
So our condition is this. Currently, neither the drug manufacturing plant nor Fermi’s whereabouts are known. If you see Fermi, give me a place.”
“What are you going to do to meet me?”
“Appeasement, or partnership if you want. Of course, it’s not like drug trafficking, but… … Because Fermi is great.”
That was what I felt at Undercorder.
“all right.”
Because Hexa could exist because of Yoga, I thought I should meet Fermi at least once.
“Is it sorted out then? Jysteen’s mercenaries pack their bags. Because there are things I want to entrust you with.”
Shirone stopped Marsha.
“Before that, there are things left in Arachne. Let’s finish that and leave.”
Although it achieved its original goal of being a beta fish, it could not leave the world beauty pageant behind.
“What’s left? What happened?”
Shirone sighed.
“that is… … .”
* * *
When Shirone arrived at the venue, there were more bodyguards around than spectators.
At the time of the terrorist attack, box office success was over, but it would be possible to promise next year only after completing the competition.
‘That person came today too.’
The man I saw at the parade was volunteering by distributing flyers today.
“Barho Rangi representing Arachne! We look forward to your love! Rangi as the winner!”
However, the slogan has changed.
‘It’s not the time to worry about others.’
Early in the morning, the contestants moved from the bunker to the competition site, and it was now up to Shirone to ensure everyone’s safety.
‘I don’t have the talent to appease.’
I took a deep breath in front of the door and knocked, but there was no sound to come in.
“Hey, this is Shirone.”
There was no response, so I turned the doorknob, and the door opened by itself, opening a gap.
“I will go in.”
Countless women were waiting in front of Shirone, whose face was sticking out.
“surprise!”
Paper firecrackers exploded and paper dust fluttered down on Shirone’s head.
“Are you surprised? Here’s our welcome ceremony! Come in quickly!”
Miss Old Hill, whose skin was like snow, pulled Syrone away, baring her teeth.
All the participants were gathered, and among them were women in only underwear.
“Uh, there… … .”
Pony met her eyes and sighed.
“sorry. It’s because of me. Yesterday, while talking to Mr. Rangi, you came up… … .”
Rangi approached with an apologetic expression.
“I think it would be safe to have you. I spoke frankly.”
“That’s fine. Because nothing is more important than safety. But this is a bit… … .”
The voice of the official was heard.
“Twenty minutes before the competition.”
As soon as the talk was over, some participants took off their underwear and started changing into swimsuits.
“Aww!”
Shirone, stricken with great fear, hurriedly turned around, and the women burst into laughter.
“Shirone is naive. It’s okay to be comfortable. For us, this is our job, and there are many male designers.”
It wasn’t just wizards who didn’t see their panties.
“Of course, not everyone is allowed to enter. But Shirone is not insidious… … .”
Rangi shyly turned around and prepared to change clothes.
“I’m not fine! hey! Get out of here!”
It was then that Pony, whose face was as hot as persimmon, pushed Shirone on the back.
‘Living?’
As I hurriedly turned around, my energy disappeared like a lie.
“Hey, hey! What if you turn around like that!”
‘Didn’t you feel Pony?’
It was only hostility toward Shirone, and the women who didn’t know why laughed.
“Ho-ho-ho! how is it? Seeing it, there’s nothing wrong, right? Still, since I had a good time, should I keep watching until the end of the tournament?”
There was nothing special at all, but there was only one thought that came to Shirone’s head.
“ah… … .”
Pony shouted even louder at Shirone’s moan.
“Get out!”
Why couldn’t I have thought of it?
‘I didn’t check the face of the terrorist. And if her diet is to steal a part of her body… … .’
This means that you can replace it with your own face.
‘Wouldn’t there be traces left?’
I looked closely at the women’s necklines, but I couldn’t find the slightest sense of incongruity.
‘Even if it’s a mental change… … .’
If only the appearance of the face had been replaced, the brain would have belonged to the terrorist, but it was impossible to confirm because the participants’ personalities were not known.
‘It was probably a mistake to lose my life.’
If the terrorist is here, the further away Shirone is, the higher the risk of getting hit.
“Don’t worry, Pony.”
Shirone said seriously.
“Because you see with your eyes, you don’t really see.”
The contestants turned their heads to Shirone, and Pony shook her shoulders with a dazed expression.
“… … What kind of crazy is that?”
Grabbing Shirone by the ear, she opened the door and dragged her outside.
“Get out, you pervert! get out quickly… … !”
“wait for a sec.”
Shirone pulled her wrist and whispered in her ear as she closed the door.
“Hasn’t there been any contestants who have gotten a little weird since this morning?”

[797] Complex (2)
Pony asked again, narrowing her eyes.
“Are you a weird person?”
“Maybe there are terrorists mixed in there.”
Pony knew what kind of ability a terrorist’s eating out was based on.
“Is it possible? I didn’t have enough space to make such an attempt. Security was really tight.”
Pony is by no means weak, but the terrorist’s skills far exceeded her expectations.
“There is a possibility that it may have changed after arriving at the venue. Do you have any tips?”
Pony looked back at the door.
“It’s a problem because there are too many of them. I went through something like that yesterday and everyone was shocked. There are people who try to act brightly, and vice versa… … .”
It was natural.
“If it’s a face swap, you won’t be able to talk. Your eyes will also be a little hazy.”
If the hostages held by the terrorists were in a normal state, they would have screamed in fear the moment their bodies were changed.
“There is, especially the one who hasn’t spoken since this morning.”
“who is this?”
Pony searched for her memory.
“As of 9 am, there are 3 people who have not said a word. Miss Weiden, Miss Nam Eymond, Miss Yakma.”
“Ummm, three people.”
“Couldn’t you rather compare heights? Even if the face has changed, the body is a terrorist. How far can you tell with your eyes?”
“About plus or minus 0.3 cm. But the terrorist’s face is covered, so we can’t determine his exact height.”
“Ultimately, you have to find it yourself. Then how about I call out one by one?”
Shirone shook her head.
“Dangerous. A woman held hostage could get hurt, and if she commits a random terror out of desperation… … .”
“Then what are you going to do?”
“Replacing a face is a precise operation. Hidden Peace should be hidden nearby. Keep an eye on the participants’ movements while I look for them.”
“okay. I’ll go in now. If you take your time, you will get suspicious.”
As Shirone ran down the hallway, Pony corrected her expression and opened the door to the waiting room.
Participants tilted their heads.
“What about Mr. Shirone?”
“I told them to wait outside and sent them back.”
“why? I really can stay with you.”
“Heh, I’m a specification. Even if no one else knows, I never change my clothes in front of my alumni.”
The other contestants didn’t suspect it when he took out his swimsuit and changed it around like that.
‘Can I make it on time?’
It was 5 minutes before the start of the competition.
‘The ability to split a space within a radius into a specific number. It must be inside the building.’
Shirone thought it was within a 100 meter radius.
‘It would be nice to use the Quantum Super Position.’
Just as you can’t stop seeing what you see with your eyes, it was impossible to drop the senses that evolved through resonance with your mouth.
‘then… … .’
It was a completely different world, and in Shirone’s world, human will can change the future.
‘Time Vibration!’
After vibrating for one second, Shirone searched all the rooms around her while the time looped.
‘doesn’t exist! Not even here!’
It was an endless second.
After looking around the entire building like that, when we arrived at the waiting room, the participants had left for the competition.
‘no. It can’t be.’
It was one of them.
‘It’s not really there, or the target is also moving.’
However, if the target was moving fast, there was no way it wouldn’t be caught in the spirit zone.
‘damn!’
Shirone eventually went out of the building at the sound of shouts from outside the venue.
“… … .”
After 20 seconds, the air where Shirone was was hardened into adamantine and formed a human form.
‘Keumgang’s innocence.’
The powder spread with a popping sound, and then Hye-ga, holding a hostage with one arm, appeared.
‘As long as I’m not thinking about anything, you can’t feel me in the Spirit Zone.’
The ability to embody the phenomenological nothingness.
Although Hui is also unable to move, there is no way to find him in the state of Vajrapani.
‘Master, is this really the right thing to do?’
As long as they belonged to the Eternal community, they had no choice but to follow orders, but taking hostages was not a Buddhist’s business.
‘What meaning will there be in the road that has lost its purpose?’
The hostage with Mortasinger’s face covered in cloth wriggled as if it would be released from the hypnotic spell.
“Grow a little longer.”
Hye-ga put her hand on her stomach and chanted, and the woman’s spasms disappeared like a lie.
“Wow, you came unexpectedly a lot?”
It was definitely less than yesterday, but more than 100 people were filling the front of the audience.
said Rangi.
“I heard that the government of Arachne sent an army specially for the tournament. Besides, the swimsuit judging is the highlight of the competition.”
The opportunity to see the world’s most beautiful women in swimsuits is rare in my life.
“Miss Arachne! This is Barho Rangi!”
The audience gathered today was one hundred thousand, and when Rangi walked out, a hot cheer erupted.
“wow! really the best! Rangi!”
Rangi’s body, which had been cultivated for a year for today, was so beautiful that it made me think it was unrealistic.
“We will have a Q&A session from now on. Why did you enter the world beauty pageant?”
“I have been interested in world peace since I was young. marginalized people in this society, and… … .”
After all, because the audience is more open-minded than ears, Rangi gave a standard answer.
‘Pony! How did it go?’
Shirone, who came out to the audience, looked at Pony, but she shook her head.
‘I don’t know. Are you really here?’
Living was real.
“Miss Weiden! This is Maroni Adelka!”
Pony gave a soft chin.
‘Keep an eye on it. He’s a prime suspect.’
She has a cheerful and light personality, and she, who readily talked to Pony, hadn’t said a word since the terror attack.
“You look great today. What is Miss Adelka’s favorite food? And why?”
Still standing with a dark expression on her face, she opened her mouth with tears in her eyes.
“at home… … want to go.”
“yes? Miss Adelka?”
“I am so scared. I don’t want to die. Terrorism is scary, just send them home.”
When the contest official gave the signal to cut, the moderator immediately turned around.
“Miss Weiden seems to be very nervous. Let’s invite the next contestant.”
As she watched Adelka cry and return to her seat, Shirone’s mind became complicated.
‘It’s not Biden. then?’
With the suspects narrowed down to two, Miss Yakma came up to the podium.
“Okay then the question… … .”
Before the host could speak, she put her hands to her face and set her nails.
‘That person!’
At the same time as the ignorant killing spree rose, the nails severely scratched his face.
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa it hurts! it hurts!”
Miss Yakma, who came to her senses, screamed when she realized that her face was clinging to someone else’s body.
The space was tangled up as the audience jumped up and the hidden peace of eating out of the regulations was activated.
‘Now!’
Shirone, who had been waiting in advance, used the sense of timing to vibrate for one second.
‘I have no choice but to kill!’
The moment when Shirone, who had returned to the moment before scratching his face, threw himself away.
‘what… … !’
Even faster than that, Mortasinger’s hands shattered Miss Yakma’s skull.
‘Only one second?’
The face of Mortar Singer, hidden in Hye-ga’s innocence, smiled faintly.
‘damn! again!’
After seeing the result, I returned to 1 second ago, but this time, Miss Yakma’s face was destroyed without a doubt.
‘I did it on purpose.’
Knowing that one second of time vibrates, he caused the first event to fill up one second.
Since the time frame of perception has been pushed away, no matter how much one second vibrates, the case of killing Miss Yakma will not change.
‘What are you going to do now? Even if you kill me, you can’t save the hostages. And if you can’t kill me… … .’
I will kill everyone in the arena.
‘One person and the whole life. Nothing can be weighed against Yahweh. You can’t do anything.’
Realizing the strategy Mortasinger had made the night before, Shirone stopped the time vibration.
“damn.”
The appearance of the Mortar Singer standing tall with his face blown off was quite hideous.
“Aww! help me! Terror!”
Pony immediately cast magic, but as Hidden Peace was activated, the earth and sky were reversed.
“People live… … !”
Woo woo woo woo!
When the ability was released in that state, the screams disappeared as if people were buried in the ground.
“Mrs. Mortasinger.”
Hyega appeared, and the Mortasinger’s face, covered with cloth, returned to the faceless body.
“Knock-knock! Knock-knock!”
As the mercenary parrots quickly approached, out of the radius of eating out, Bodhidharma blocked their way.
“Geumgangjang!”
Bodhidharma held out his hand, and the air was compressed in the form of a giant palm, stopping the display.
Mortasinger pointed at Shirone.
“How are you sure? Whether it be Yahweh or whatever, this is what happens when you touch the Church of the Ten Lords.”
“… … .”
Shirone’s eyes were cold.
“I will never forgive you.”
“okay? However much. However, even Yahweh cannot bring back the dead. I won!”
“Ataraxia.”
As the huge halo exploded like thunder, colorful information was accumulated.
“Ho-ho-ho! kill! I won though! All the pretty things in the world are dead!”
“… … Hexagonal.”
Although the result was unpredictable magic, the enraged Shirone penetrated the magic circle of amplification without hesitation.
“Big!”
As the sense of time and space expanded enormously, the only time that existed in the universe paralyzed the ninth sense.
“Aaaaaaaaa!”
And it vibrates with time vibration.
‘I can hold on!’
As the timeline wobbled at an amplitude of plus or minus 30 minutes, events began to flow in reverse order.
30 minutes ago.
“Huh! Huh!”
At the entrance of the building at the venue, Shirone exhaled a heavy breath while lying on the ground.
‘It’s like this.’
Whether it is one second or one hour, time vibration is a phenomenon that resets the local time zone.
‘If I could bounce back to the beginning of time… … .’
reset.
It was the administrator’s inherent authority, which only beings with 10-level stateless senses could do.
‘Even in the land system, at least an hour.’
I hadn’t even figured out how to reset the time perfectly.
‘First of all, saving people comes first.’
time is space
It was not possible to cover all the space, but the people of the convention hall could be saved in one hour of resonance.
‘The culprit is Miss Yakma.’
Killing the terrorist would prevent a massacre, but it could not save the hostages she had captured.
‘The one-armed monk was holding it. Judging by the ability, it’s not the movement of the target, but the one that doesn’t exist.’
Still nothing was caught in the spirit zone.
‘First, let’s poke and see the reaction.’
Now that it was the vibration of the first round, Shirone, who was at ease, approached the door of the waiting room.
“I will go in.”
Knowing that it was already open, Shirone opened the door roughly and went in, and the participants set off firecrackers.
“surprise!”
There was a popping sound and the paper dust fluttered, but Shirone didn’t even blink.
“Are you surprised? Here’s our welcome ceremony! Come in quickly!”
Miss Yakma’s nonchalant face was seen in Shirone’s eyes as she followed as she pulled her wrist.

[798] Complex (3)
When I entered the waiting room, the events I had already experienced began to happen sequentially.
“Sorry, it’s because of me. Yesterday, while talking to Mr. Rangi, you came up… … .”
Barron’s prediction was correct.
‘I’m saying it exactly as it is without a single mistake.’
Humans cannot change the future.
The gear wheels of the law that operated this world were meshed with such precision.
‘In fact, even the nuance of words is a world determined by the law. I can understand why Uorin considers Harbitz dangerous.’
If it is chaos, it will react differently each time.
‘What shall I do now?’
Rangi has arrived.
“I think it would be safe to have you. I spoke frankly.”
Shirone nodded and moved to Miss Yakma and Laura the Elf.
“hello?”
I was thinking of checking the reaction first.
Laura turned her head with an expressionless face.
‘I guess. It must be hypnotized.’
My teeth trembled as I remembered the culprit behind the terror, the horrific murders she had committed.
“Twenty minutes before the competition.”
As soon as the officials spoke, a ghastly murderous feeling spread from Laura before she had time to try anything.
‘damn!’
The psychology of the terrorist was extreme and sensitive enough to trigger eating out just by saying hello.
‘I have to kill!’
When the Wind Cutter was cast, Laura’s throat fell and a fountain of blood gushed out.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
Participants screamed, and Pony made an absurd expression in an unexpected situation.
“What are you doing right now!”
Shirone examined Laura’s face.
“Ouch!”
At the same time that the hypnosis was lifted, he made a shocked expression, then pulled out his tongue and died.
‘You killed the body. Is this a one-armed monk?’
Mortar Singer, who had already been baptized by Time Vibration, had put insurance on it.
A declaration of war saying, ‘If you kill me, I will kill the hostages. I can’t use my hands like this.’
We have to turn back time.
‘The way to look at the reaction won’t work. Unless you approach it differently… … :
Then the door opened and the guards came in.
“What, what, what is this?”
Jaysteen opened her eyes wide, and Marsha looked at Shirone as if she couldn’t understand.
“… … Did you kill him?”
Shirone made no excuses.
“yes.”
“why?”
How about asking Marsha for help?
‘Not yet.’
Just like the repetition of a second that Hugo or a terrorist suffered, Time Vibration can shake other people’s time as well.
‘That’s resonance.’
But this time alone was good.
‘If Marsha’s sister’s time zone resonates… … .’
Together with Shirone, they are trapped in an endless cycle of time until the desired result is achieved.
‘Ten times? If it’s a hundred times, I’ll endure it.’
But what if 1,000, 10,000 times?
‘Someday I’ll go crazy.’
A life in which an hour repeats itself tens of thousands of times had no ability to endure unless it was an infinite wizard.
“I can’t tell you now.”
While the participants hurriedly covered themselves, the guards grabbed Shirone and dragged her away.
The contest was canceled with 20 minutes remaining.
“say it! What the hell is going on!”
Sitting in the empty audience seats, Shirone counted the time in her head without answering.
‘5 minutes and 39 seconds. 38 seconds. 37 seconds.’
The Star of the Ivory Tower could not be taken away, but the guards still surrounded him.
“I will do it properly from now on.”
Realizing that the time has come, Shirone raised her head.
“What are you doing right?”
Plus 30 minutes to this point.
“See you again, sister.”
At the same time as he finished speaking, the timeline bounced and flowed back towards minus 30 minutes.
“cadet! Shit!”
The shaking of the timeline made her head thump, but Shirone didn’t collapse anymore.
‘Entrance to the venue.’
It was 30 minutes before the terrorist attack.
‘The one-armed monk will be near the waiting room. As soon as the terrorist dies, the hostage is killed.’
If it was at a level that could not be detected even by Yahweh’s realm, it would have been an ability close to nothing.
‘Therefore, if the terrorist is not killed, there is a possibility that even a one-armed monk will not receive information from the outside.’
Shirone ran to the waiting room.
‘The line between a terrorist and Miss Yakma. If you can cut exactly that point, you can save the hostage.’
Having made that decision, Shirone opened the door and the participants set off paper firecrackers.
“surprise!”
Ignoring everyone else, Shirone rushed inside and hung the wind cutter on the lower part of Laura’s neck.
“Ouch!”
The terrorist died instantly, followed by the death of Laura.
‘It takes 1.43 seconds to figure out.’
That was enough time.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
At the sound of women’s screams, the guards rushed in and Shirone sat down in an empty audience seat.
“say it! What the hell is going on!”
Shirone looked up at Marsha and said.
“See you again, sister.”
3rd car.
“surprise!”
Again, the terrorist is dead.
‘No one should die.’
The plus or minus 0.3 cm that Shirone can capture, you have to divide the boundary line exactly within it.
17th Tea.
“surprise!”
Blood gushed from the killer’s neck like a fountain.
The 68th Tea.
“Surf… … .”
After a surprise greeting that was no longer surprising, Shirone activated the wind cutter.
‘It passed.’
If until now the dead were the terrorists, this time Miss Yakma was decapitated.
‘There’s a boundary between me.’
It was impossible to see with the naked eye, but if you go into brown rice, there must be gaps larger than atoms.
Marsha always said the same thing.
“say it! What the hell is going on!”
“… … .”
Time flowed backwards without an answer.
287th Tea.
Shirone’s mind, which had been decapitated for approximately 287 hours, was in a hazy state.
‘I found 0.6 cm, but it’s too difficult to accurately cut between them.’
Just as there are 1,000 0.0001 cm in 0.1 cm, as long as you don’t know the scale, your attempts will continue.
“Twenty minutes before the competition.”
The terrorist’s life was felt, and the participants changed their clothes and started throwing jokes.
“How are you? Seeing it, there’s nothing special, right? Still, since I had a good time, should I keep watching until the end of the tournament?”
The scene that I had already seen dozens of times over and over again for an hour did not convey any inspiration anymore.
“Laura.”
When Shirone held out her hand and spoke to her, a fleshy feeling rose from Laura’s body.
‘Wind cutter.’
Although the body and face were identical and separate, they were completely indistinguishable from the naked eye.
“found.”
The accuracy was 0.3736 cm.
‘The hostage is not dead.’
Hyega didn’t feel anything, and Mortar Singer’s body floundered as if embarrassed.
‘I can’t stop this time anyway.’
At the same time the terrorist destroys Laura’s face, the wind cutter will peck at her torso.
Marsha shouted from the empty audience.
“say it! What the hell is going on!”
“sister.”
The regression occurred, and for the first time, Shirone resonated her timeline with his own.
“let’s go together.”
288th Tea.
As soon as the door to the waiting room was opened, Shirone rushed in and separated Laura and the terrorist by the neck.
‘If you know the boundaries… … .”
The location of the hidden piece can be moved.
“Now!”
Mortasinger’s face covered in cloth returned, and Hyega appeared in the hallway.
‘how?’
Shock flickered in Hye-ga’s eyes.
‘Oops! Hostages!’
Realizing it belatedly, he heard the capital, but Marsha snatched Laura faster than that.
“I don’t know what it is… … .”
The more I listened to Shirone’s explanation, the more difficult it was, but it was clear that he had returned an hour.
“Hide and seek is over!”
Sliding next to Hye-ga, she twisted her waist and inserted the dagger of her virtuoso into her back.
“Keugh!”
I didn’t feel any pain.
“Eating out?”
The smoke of desire was escaping from Hye-ga’s back at a rate of 1 percent per minute.
“don’t worry. Because we can fight for 100 minutes.”
Being clear about each other’s location is a disadvantage of the dagger of the Parryun, but this time it worked as an advantage.
“Marsha, what’s going on?”
Freeman, who came belatedly into the building, protected Marsha with agile movements.
‘I really don’t know.’
Martha had experienced it once, but Freeman was puzzled by the sudden situation.
‘You’re getting closer to God, Shirone.’
If regression is possible, it would have been better if he had spoken in the first round.
‘It’s my wish to hit this guy’s face properly.’
Looking at Hyega’s movements, Marsha said.
“There is one more person outside. Take a hostage and stop him. No one should die.”
Being trapped in endless time was a specification.
“Did you say 100 minutes?”
When Hye-ga lifted the sword, the air she touched crystallized into adamantine and shimmered like a sword.
“go.”
The gunner’s movement was like the wind.
“You won’t last even 100 seconds.”
As Hyega set up the capital and ran, Marsha put her hand on the tattoo on her body.
“The dagger of immorality.”
A dagger was in her hand.
“How dare you interfere with my work!”
Hit by Shirone’s photon cannon, Mortar Singer pierced the wall and flew into the sky.
‘How the hell did you find out?’
Even if it was unavoidable to let go of life, it was impossible to accurately determine the boundary of the neck.
“Hidden Peace!”
He tried to pressurize him by invoking Eating Rules, but it didn’t work for Shirone, who had already dealt with dozens of times.
“I mean stop!”
Tied to her with a shining chain, Shirone plummeted toward the mountain visible from the ground.
“Quaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”
To this extent, the Eternals do not die.
“What on earth do you not like!”
The attack stopped only after he continued to beat her left and right until she was exhausted.
“Turn it off.”
She couldn’t move a single finger, but Shirone didn’t break the spell.
“done. If you show your face, the eating out will disappear, right?”
Mortasinger shuddered.
“Please, please just kill me! You don’t want to see such an ugly face!”
“shut up! I know what you did!”
If he hadn’t turned back time, he would have killed everyone in the arena.
“What do you know about me? Pretty things, it’s okay to die. No, I will kill them all!”
Shirone was heartbroken.
“No matter how ugly you are, if you don’t love yourself… … .”
She screamed as the cloth covering Mortasinger’s face was violently ripped off.
“No eh eh eh!”
“what?”
The woman’s face, with her eyes tightly closed, was as smooth as a pearl without a single scar.
“Please don’t look. Cover your face.”
Shirone did not think that human beauty could be measured by numbers.
But what is clear is that Mortar Singer, who shed tears even if he asked 100 people, would be called beautiful.
“Are you pretty?”
Even participating in a beauty pageant was enough.
“Don’t lie! What is this pretty? Where in the world is there an ugly person like me!”
I was a little annoyed.
“It’s not like that, it’s really pretty!”
Mortasinger did not listen.
“Why are my eyes so torn? Why can’t my nose be sharper? Look at my lips, these blurry lips.”
“iced coffee.”
Shirone realized.
‘Eating out.’
Mortasinger is beautiful, but his heart is so twisted that even he looks ugly.
“My dirty, ugly, disgusting face!”
It is the incarnation of a complex.
—————————————

[799] Complex (4)
“Kill.”
Mortasinger was sincere.
“I am tired of living with such an ugly face. You can do anything, so kill me in the end.”
It was an ability that was manifested because it was a complex bigger than death and pain.
“I will not kill you.”
Mortasinger made a puzzled expression.
“I know that the biggest problem is the heart. If it can be changed easily, no one will suffer. but… … .”
She is definitely a beautiful person.
“It is not that there is no way. I can help you love yourself.”
Mortasinger’s reaction was cold.
“You don’t know. Because it is beautiful. You’ve never lived with an ugly face like me.”
“You are not ugly either.”
“lie.”
Shirone made a mirror out of material and reflected it.
“Come on, look at your face.”
“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!”
As Mortasinger turned his head in panic, Shirone pressed harder.
“Look! this is you! What on earth is this ugly thing about?”
“Get it away! Why do you keep torturing me!”
If catharsis had only occurred to this extent, he would not have committed a brutal terror.
“If you can’t admit it, trust others. I think you are beautiful.”
“lie! You pity me!”
“It’s not a lie. It’s okay to risk your life.”
Mortasinger suddenly widened his eyes.
“Then die. die in front of me Then I will believe you.”
“okay.”
After releasing the Shining Chain, Shirone took Mortar Singer’s hand and brought it to her neck.
“I cannot commit suicide. So kill me.”
Shirone, who included himself as the object of fraternity, cannot strangle himself.
For him, suicide is the same weight as killing all life in the world.
“joy! do you know you can’t Even if the ability is gone, it’s like breaking your neck… … !”
The leader of the Tenro Society is strong, and her gripe has been terrifyingly suffocating Shirone.
Shirone closed her eyes and quietly waited for death.
There was no particular thought that she would change her mind or realize something through this act.
‘Just believing.’
that human beings are capable of making choices.
‘No matter how dirty your heart is… … .’
Even if it’s a demon.
‘There is no such thing as an irreversible mind.’
That was the only hope that Parrae dreamed of in the world of emptiness that Buddha realized in the confrontation between good and evil.
Mortasinger’s arms trembled.
‘why? Why so far… … .’
It felt like a ray of light was seeping into my perfectly twisted mind.
“Really I… … .”
Mortasinger slowly withdrew his hand.
“Pretty?”
* * *
Whenever Hyega moved, adamantine crystallized in the air and formed the Milky Way.
‘I can’t breathe!’
By law, matter is converted into energy, but if you inhale it before that, your lungs will be damaged.
“There are quite a few ways to escape.”
Missing the dagger, Marsha stepped back and said.
“Has 100 seconds already passed?”
Hye-ga, who responded with a snort, rushed forward, covering her body with diamonds, and Marsha opened her arms.
“It’s okay to kill me.”
The ‘extortion’ of eating out has already disappeared with catharsis by Shirone, but her determination is not different from that time.
As the sharp capital stabbed in, Marsha twisted and hugged Hyega from behind.
‘Let’s see who dies.’
As soon as he took out a new dagger from the inside of his thigh, he hacked at Hye-ga’s body at random.
As the number of sheaths increased to 12, the gas of desire at a rate of 12% per minute began to leak out.
“Are you ready to die!”
While avoiding Hyega’s attack at close range, he did not stop the sheathing action.
‘Even if I step back, I will die.’
Hye-ga was also realizing it now.
‘I catch it first!’
He drove Marsha into the wall with his excellent martial arts and stabbed Marsha in the abdomen.
“Ouch!”
At the same time, Hye-ga’s desire was exposed and she lost her free will.
“Uh, why… … ?”
I definitely felt the water stabbing my stomach.
“It’s a shame.”
Marsha, who tucked her belly in, lifted the hem of her dress and showed off her belly button as if she were proud of her ant waist.
“A cowardly trick… … .”
“cowardice?”
When Marsa shoved her shoulder, the exhausted Hyega fell backwards.
“Do you think it’s easy to maintain this body at 30?”
“… … .”
Marsha, who was looking at Hye-ga, who couldn’t even speak, turned her head toward the doorway.
“Are you still not done? get out of here.”
As Bodhidharma soared several tens of meters high, performing a burial, huge palm prints were stamped on the ground.
“damn! That goddamn bastard!”
The steel strength and wind pressure alone were enough to lift the body, and there seemed to be no way to drop it other than interception.
“I will try.”
When Seik, a member of the clan, bent his lower body, the tattoo of Ho (虎) on his right thigh was awakened.
“Qualifications of the Fierce Tiger.”
As they kicked towards the sky, the wild cries of beasts burst from the air.
Aaaaaang!
The shock wave, which bypassed the space greatly, exploded in close proximity of Bodhidharma, causing turbulence.
‘Keugh!’
Tiger’s ability side attack can superimpose dozens of rotation vectors on the shockwave.
“The Diamond Sutra.”
When Bodhidharma reached out with both hands to the ground, it made a popping sound and soared higher and higher.
“Pungryu, great power rachal.”
He put his palms together and stretched out his hands like a knife, and the air compressed with iron strength shot out like a spear.
Aaaaaang!
An explosion erupted as the two techniques interlocked in the middle.
“hey! Why so noisy! What are you guys doing?”
Marsha, who dragged Hyega by the back of her head, pointed at Freeman and shouted.
“wait. I got almost all of them.”
The moment when Freeman, who had reloaded the magic bullet, aimed at Bodhidharma and was about to pull the trigger.
“huh?”
As the setting sun sets on the mountain ridge, a purple glow arose for a brief moment.
“Mrs. Mortasinger.”
* * *
“Of course she is pretty.”
Shirone smiled and nodded.
“I’m serious. never lie.”
“I… … Are you pretty?”
I still can’t believe it, but it was the first time someone risked their lives to guarantee it.
“come with me. I know someone who can help you believe my words.”
Miro and Arius could save her by diving into Mortasinger’s Hell.
“Can you forgive me?”
Yahweh does not discriminate against the penitent.
“Nothing has happened yet. You will fight with us from now on.”
Wei Ying.
‘Really?’
A fly came into the forest.
‘Really in this hell… … .’
Mortar Singer, who was about to grab Shirone’s outstretched hand, withdrew his arm and shrank.
“no! I can’t forgive you! This is a trap!”
The moment Shirone’s lips opened, the world froze in a gray light and everything stopped.
“Aaaaaaaaa.”
A choir was heard from the sky to a grand dirge.
“Who, who are you?”
Before I knew it, 12 people all dressed in black were standing in a circle around Mortasinger.
“Time prison.”
Time without law – 0.666 seconds of every second.
“Greeting him.”
As Siok turned in one direction, the achromatic world peeled away, revealing a huge lake of lava.
“Your suspicion is justified, my child.”
The center of the huge lava lake bulged out, revealing a figure covered in blood.
Atrocities – Satan.
It was a burning voice.
“Yahweh is deceiving you. He only I can give you what you want.”
Invoking the prison from outside the psychic realm is an abortion, but God is currently absent in this world.
“what I want?”
“Look, my child.”
A red-glazed mirror rose from Satan’s side, reflecting Mortasinger.
“ah… … Ahhh… … .”
A mirror reflecting the heart.
The image in the mirror was terrifying, but to Mortasinger it was the most beautiful form in the world.
“This is exactly what I wanted!”
“I can give it to you. worship me To be the most beautiful woman in the world.”
It was a much sweeter proposal than Shirone.
“I will follow. Please give me that beauty!”
The chorus of funeral songs grew louder.
“… … The contract has been established.”
Mortar Singer was also submerged as if he had fallen into a swamp along with the 12 Siok that seeped into the ground.
“no.”
Suddenly coming to her senses, she shouted.
‘no! That’s not me!’
Realizing the evil inside reflected in the mirror, he struggled, but the contract with Satan could not be reversed.
“Save me, Shirone! Save me!”
He eagerly stretched out his hand, but the distance from Shirone’s outstretched hand grew farther and farther.
“Ha ha ha! I’m taking it away, Yahweh! You will get everyone you love!”
In a time not according to the law, Satan poured mockery into Shirone’s ear.
“As long as there is no Buddha, the world is mine. Hateful Yahweh, struggle in pain for the rest of your life.”
Mortasinger’s face sank into the ground.
“Shirone… … .”
When the prison was completely gone, Satan, who took the form of a human, was also dipped in the fire of hell.
As the infernal landscape finally closed, a huge purple glow spread for a split second.
It was 0.666 seconds.
“huh?”
As Mortar Singer disappeared in front of her eyes, Shirone narrowed her eyes and stood up.
“What happened?”
kidnap?
‘No, it’s not like that. Even if the speed cannot be seen with the eyes, it must remain in the mind.’
It is impossible without time stopping.
‘But how? Even if it’s a stop magic, it can’t affect things.’
Shirone’s eyes widened.
“Satan.”
Only beings outside the law can deceive Yahweh.
‘Does the fact that apostasy is possible mean that atrocities are the same?’
The momentary doubt that sprouted in Mortasinger’s heart was dug into and dragged into hell.
“I have to tell Zion.”
Shirone, who flew up with fly magic, quickly returned to the arena.
The battle was in a lull, and Bodhidharma and Marsha, who supported Hyega, ran at the same time.
“Shirone! What happened?”
“Who is Mortasinger?”
Shirone looked back at Bodhidharma and reported the situation.
“Did you go to hell?”
“I think the demons changed their methods after Terraforce tolerated the apostasy. He will not be able to get out on his own.”
“Hmm.”
Bodhidharma exchanged glances with Hyega.
“Anyway, our leader. The Eternal community will go to Zion. If it is there, you will find a way.”
“I am of the same opinion. However, I cannot guarantee that they will accept you.”
That’s what he said, but Miro will accept it.
‘Because it’s polar.’
After looking around, Shirone realized that there were no fatalities and canceled the time vibration.
“Are you done with this? It was fun.”
Marsha was disappointed, but Shirone, who had already experienced the same thing hundreds of times, hated it.
‘What happened in Satan’s time cannot be intervened.’
Perhaps, even if we went back to a time that did not exist in the law, Mortasinger would not exist in reality.
“Shirone! Where have you been? I thought you were afraid to die!”
Beauty pageant contestants approached.
“The terrorist was caught. From now on, you can play the competition with peace of mind.”
Rangi asked, turning bright.
“really? Are you really caught?”
Before Shirone could answer, she hugged her neck and jumped around.
“Hurray! Liberation at last!”
Not to be outdone, the other contestants hugged.
“thank you. But what if I’m sorry? If I had been in the waiting room, I could have had a good look.”
“No, that’s all right.”
Seriously, it was a specification.

Chapter - 800 - Law Murder (1).txt
===============================
law murder
“The winner of the world beauty pageant!”
As news spread that the terrorist had been caught, the event was held again with great success.
“Miss Arachne! Barho Rangi!”
The crowd that almost filled the audience stood up and applauded, and Rangi shed tears of joy.
“Thank you thank you!”
She had seen all the bitterness in the world until she came to this place, so the tears now were sincere.
“Congratulations, Rangi.”
It was an honor for Shirone that Pony, the representative of Tormia, took second place.
‘That’s great, Pony.’
Having achieved her own achievements, she would return to her hometown and devote herself to magic training again.
“Are you done now?”
Marsha and J. Steen approached Shirone, who was standing at the end of the audience.
The Jaysteen Mercenary Corps had already left after being merged with the Parrot Mercenary Corps, but Shirone wanted to confirm the outcome of the tournament.
“yes. We must start now.” Marcia let out the smoke from her cigarette, squinting her eyes.
“Are you trying to do something weird again?”
Shirone smiled instead, and as the applause died down, Rangi spoke up.
“thank you everyone. First of all, with the director of the beauty style hair shop who made me who I am today… …
A tournament official came to Shirone.
“Magician of the Ivory Tower, I should have told you in advance, but I was not in a hurry because of the terror… …
He handed over the sheet music for ‘Rain of Light’ with Maya’s autograph written on it.
“Mr. Maya asked me to deliver it in person. Just give it to me and you’ll know what I mean… …
Maya said she would stay until the tournament was over, but her agency wouldn’t allow it.
“okay.”
Shirone nodded her head, keeping her eyes on the lyrics that contained every word of her heart.
“Yes, Maya is right. thank you.”
The reason she didn’t face her and left only her heart was her wish not to decide anything.
‘I’ll be able to meet you again.’
higher than now.
“let’s go. Are you busy?” After bidding her goodbyes with Marsha, Shirone took Jay Steen and left the capital.
Caidra, a monstrous bird that was orbiting the sky, landed in front of them with a groaning noise.
“You want to ride this?”
Jaysteen’s eyes widened.
“huh. Because I rode it when I came. Khaid Raya, which the Empress of Kashan rides herself. My name is Ratusa.”
Rattusa stroked Shirone’s cheek with her beak.
‘It’s a 3-tier monster.’
Among the monsters that Jysteen’s mercenaries had caught so far, the strongest was only a Tier 5 monster.
It was only overlooked because it was specialized in flight, and it was a powerful creature that could peck out quite a few monsters like insects.
“You’re not eating people, are you?”
“haha! no way?”
Eating people doesn’t mean you can eat sirones, so I’ve never checked.
Jaysteen looked at him in terror, but Shirone, riding on Kydra, gestured to him as if to tempt him.
“Is this your first time? Come up.”
In her eyes, Kaidra looked like a giant monster with a Shirone attached to it.
Arriving at the hotel and packing up, Rangi sipped on the sofa until the bodyguard arrived.
“Haa, it’s over anyway.”
The joy of winning was short-lived, and the hardships so far passed through my mind like a kaleidoscope.
‘Shirone.’
What remained at the end of the kaleidoscope was the afterimage of the strongest wizard in the world.
Rangi shook his head as he gazed at the ‘Dragon Beater Grand Mage’ left behind by Shirone.
“Idiot, what are you thinking?”
The world we live in is different.
‘It’s not strong or weak, it’s not for that reason.’
What mages pursue is spirit, not matter, and Rangi will never be able to understand them.
“Rangi, I brought you Bunny.”
“Come on in.”
A man with magpie-like hair and a sparse beard entered with a timid gesture.
“Jeong, is it really Mr. Rangi?”
Seeing Rangi sitting on the sofa, Bunny trembled as if he was moved.
“Sit. I asked to be called because I wanted to personally say thank you.”
It was a lifetime honor because he went from being a world beauty pageant maniac to a Rangi maniac.
“thank you! thank you!”
Rangi smiled.
“On the contrary, I am grateful. You saved me then.”
When Mecha’s explosive bullets flew from the mountain, he was the only one to jump onto the stage.
“How did I help you?”
In fact, it was Shirone who prevented the terror, so Rangi leaned her upper body as she sat down with an embarrassed expression.
“I’m sorry, but I don’t have much time. I have to go to the royal castle for a celebratory performance.”
“haha! Yes, of course. It’s enough for me to see Mr. Rangi up close like this.”
“So if you have something to say, do it now.”
“yes’?”
Rangi raised an eyebrow.
“Since you risked your life for me, I will informally grant your wish. You can ask for anything.”
Bernie gulped as he reached a single thought in his head.
“Is that true?”
“Did you call me for a joke? Please tell me.”
“You may think me strange, but if you really want to say a wish, tonight… …
Rangi nodded.
“Yes, tonight?”
cried Bernie, closing his eyes tightly.
“One dinner, please!”
“Yes, dinner… … yes?”
Rangi blinked his eyes.
“That, and I’m really sorry, I know it’s really shameless, but it’s my lifelong wish! please just once… … She hurriedly rummaged through her backpack and pulled out an optical camera that Bernie had bought for a fortune.
“If you take just one photo for authentication… …
Looking at Rangi’s dazed expression, he concluded his speech in a crawling voice.
“Can’t I?”
Rangi couldn’t help but ask.
“I beg your pardon? Is that your real wish?”
Bernie was very intimidated.
“Certification Photo… … . to my friends… … to brag… …
“Ha ha, ha ha ha ha!”
Rangi, relaxed, leaned back on the sofa and burst into laughter as he looked up at the ceiling.
‘I see. It was like that.’
Wizard.
I felt like I could understand a little bit of their lives.
Emperor Aganos.
“If you want to know about someone, be most humble in front of that person.”
Wu Lin said.
“Human beings show their true colors in the end because they want to be superior. But if you’re the one who doesn’t change… … Gando replied.
“He is a trustworthy person.”
“no. Just keep being humble until that person shows up.” “It is a question of who can be patient. Some people easily consume emotions. If you criticize and put down others, you may look a little superior, but there is nothing left, right?”
When emotions are revealed, desire disappears.
“The superiority of the heart is just an illusion. The real superiority is visible.”
Uorin spread her arms.
“An imperial castle adorned with jewels, an army stretching to the end of the horizon, and an enormous amount of gold coins. All of these are things that I was able to actually gain because I gave up the sense of superiority of the heart.”
It will be the king’s philosophy.
“So don’t sell your feelings cheaply. Hide yourself and use other people’s thoughts. That’s what the game is all about.”
“I have a question.”
Gando intervened.
“According to the Queen’s theory, isn’t it taboo to reveal the king’s technique to me right now?”
“To be sharp.”
Wu Lin walked to the window.
“Gando, by any chance, don’t you want to become an emperor?”
I just found out
“mother.”
“It is a great purification. I don’t have any more minor incidents left. In an unknown world, the person I chose is Shirone.”
She is not thinking of giving birth to a daughter.
“This is an extreme judgment.”
“It is an extreme world. Havitz’s chaos is the natural enemy of Theraje, which is based on logic.”
“There is also a way to form an alliance.” From Gando’s point of view, it wasn’t bad for Kashan and Gustav to divide the world into two.
“You can’t give up on Shirone.”
“Hasn’t it been running for many years? If now is the only chance to bloom in Theraje’s life… …
Because they should bloom someday, they endured eternity.
“Shirone-sama has arrived.” As her guards arrived outside her, Wu Lin’s face brightened like a girl’s.
“Let’s go, Gando.”
Looking at her back as she ran toward the door, Gando let out a long breath.
‘Emperor? I?’
Gando is the son of Terase, it is true that he borrowed his mother’s womb, but his genes were not mixed.
‘What are you looking at?’ I couldn’t understand her giving up her eons of history in order to live her life with her loved one.
‘I’m not someone who moves only with emotions. perhaps… …
We may have already reached the end of an era.
“Your skills have improved more than before.” said Gustav’s military Vulcan, looking down at the dozens of chess in front of him.
“okay? You don’t even know the rules?”
Harvits was not interested in chess, just taking and placing pieces at random.
‘That’s why it’s bizarre.’
It seems to be left alone, but the odds against Vulcan, a genius soldier, were close to 50%.
‘It’s not even reading the military standard. I’m just going to keep fighting so that it’s a fun situation.’
Because they don’t care about winning or losing, the odds are 50%.
‘If you’re determined to win, no, isn’t that also compatible with chaos?’
Vulcan asked.
“What is the philosophy that governs humans, Your Highness?”
Harvitz’s Theory of the King.
“There is no such thing. It’s too simple. Even if you sort apples here and there, you end up with only four fruits.”
“But aren’t there people like strawberries and people like pears? They are all different.”
“Because there is none.”
Harvits raised his head.
“Everyone thinks they are the best. But you put it in a warehouse and beat it with a club for three days, right?”
Harvitz pretended to be sick.
“Oops, I’m dying! yes That apple is a pear! you are god! I am a dog!”
Vulcan blinked.
“It’s really strange. If it’s really the best, it should be the best whether it’s hit with a club or gutted, but they always change their words.”
“haha.”
Havitz touched his mustache.
“If that’s the case, I don’t know why I usually think I’m right. Look what kind of disease it is.”
“Puhahahaha!”
Vulcan hit the knee
“What an insight! majesty!”
It was a very hot summer.
A record-breaking heat wave raged, and the bloody smell shook the border between Ka Shan and Gustav.
“With this, everything is ready.”
To Uorin’s left was the Ex-Machina’s Eruki team, and to the right was the Shirone’s team who was in charge of <Spell Killing>.
“It’s the only chance to kill Havitz.”
Minerva looked back at Abella, who stood in the center.
‘Abella and Jaysteen are both perfect, but the one with the higher probability is the alpha fish.’
While staying in the imperial castle for half a year, Abella and Jaysteen never met.
Considering their relationship, it was natural, but in reality, it was a strategic decision.
“Youth Abella. The lives of countless people are now in your hands. You know?”
“Do not worry. You will not make a mistake.”
There was no sense of tension on Abella’s face after repeated analysis and learning with top experts.
‘Mister Harvits, I’m coming. To kill you.’
Since the emperor’s character is tyrannical, it is only natural for the attendants to run away and suffer from a manpower shortage.
“I will depart.”
Alpha Fish’s first mission was to enter the Gustav Empire as a handmaid and have an audience with Habitz.
